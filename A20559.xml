            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cor. 2. 1. Without affected excellencie of words or carnall wiſdome. They were collected by a godly ingenious young man, whoſe diligent attention and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, deſerne no ſmall commendations: yet what hand or memorie can follow ſo

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE wordes containe a preparation to ſtirre vs vp to keepe the law of God, partly in generall, to all the keeping of all the commaundements. Partly more ſpecially, to the keeping of the firſt. That preparatiue which pertaines generally to all, is in theſe words God ſpake. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they haue God for the author of them, therefore wee muſt ſettle our ſelues to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them without gainſaying, becauſe God will not bee diſputed withall. The preparation to the firſt commandement, more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is drawne partly from the nature of God, partly from his benefites. His nature, where hee ſaith, <hi>I am Iehouah,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the eſſence of God, incommunicable to any creature. From his benefits, either generall in thoſe words thy God. i. One that haue bound my ſelfe in couenant with thee, to bee thine, and to do thee good in matters for this life, and the life to come. Or elſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in the laſt wordes, <hi>which haue brought thee out of the land of

                  <p>In that it bringeth the author of theſe wordes, hee ſaith God ſpake them. This doctrine ariſeth to vs, that God is after a ſpeciall the author of the tenne commaundements, they are his words more ſpecially then any other. And as all ſcripture is to be regarded as proceeding from God, ſo more eſpecially theſe tenne words, becauſe they bee after a more peculiar ſort Gods words.</p>

Where <hi>Moyſes</hi> hauing repeated this law, ſets downe two priuiledges that it had aboue all other ſcripture, to winne the more authoritie vnto it. Firſt, hee ſaith theſe words, the Lord ſpake vnto all your multitude, noteing this vnto them, that whereas the ceremoniall and indiciall lawes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the miniſtery of Angels, and the other ſcriptures, by the meanes of the men of God the Prophets, theſe wordes and theſe commaundements, God himſelfe, as it were in his owne perſon full of Mageſtie and terrour, accompanied with all his Angels, in a flame of fire, did pronounce ſo terribly in the bearing of them all, as that they trembled, and came to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> requeſting him that they might no more heare God ſpeaking on this manner, for if they did aſſuredly they ſhould die for feare, wherefore in this firſt regard they muſt bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reuerenced, becauſe Gods owne voice did ſpeake them.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29174:9"/>
                  <p>Secondly, for the writing of them, they were not written as other ſcriptures, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, holy men of God write according to the inſtinct of Gods holy ſpirit within them, but God him ſelfe did write them, as it were with his owne finger, not vſing thereto either men or Angells as inſtruments. Yea at the firſt hee made the Tables himſelfe alſo, (that there might bee nothing ſeene, wherein was not the immediate worke of God,) vvherein they were written, but afterwardes when <hi>Moyſes</hi> brake them before the Iſralites, that had made the goulden Calfe, to ſhew that they by their idolatrie had broken the couenaunt, and vvere vvorthie to be caſt off, then though God did bid <hi>Moyſes</hi> make the ſecond Tables, yet himſelfe write the law, not vſing thereto the miniſtry of any of his creatures, ſhewing that in this regarde they bee more ſpecially GODS wordes, and ſo more to bee regarded: And beſides this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, diuers reaſons may bee vſed, to ſhew that theſe are GODS owne inuention, and wordes after an extraordinarie manner.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the wonderfull and perfect holineſſe that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in them, ſhewes who is the firſt founder of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no good dutie, which God bound <hi>Adam</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, but it is comprehended and commaunded in one of theſe, and there is no ſinne, that wee are bound to abſtaine from and eſchew, which is not forbidden, in ſome one of theſe tenne wordes. It was aboue the witte of men or Angells to containe in ſo few wordes, the whole perfection of our dutie; to God and man.</p>
                  <p>The lawes of men, though they fill many large bookes and great volumnes, yet they are imperfect, and doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtande in neede to haue ſome increaſing or deminiſhing, and daylie ſome thing is added to them, that was not beefore thought vpon, and ſome thinges bee taken away, which novv more experience hath prooued not to bee ſo profitable, ſo that yet they ſtill ſtand in neede of renewing and mending. But now, this Law is ſo abſolute and doth ſet foorth ſo full and complete a righteouſneſſe, that if one could keepe them all, hee ſhould bee
<pb facs="tcp:29174:10"/> fully acceptable vnto God and needed not flie to Chriſt, to bee his redeemer. For indeede this meets with all ſinnes, yea with the firſt &amp; leaſt motions, as Paule ſaith, that hee had not knowne, that luſt, (meaning the motions of originall concupiſence) had beene ſinne, but that the law ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> And as their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holineſſe doth witneſſe ſufficiently from what an one they had their beginning. So ſecondly this will proue them to bee the words of God, becauſe they bee ingraffed and written and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in euery mans conſcience, ſo that let wicked men ſhuffle and take one, and keepe what ſtirre they can to make themſelues A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, yet it will not be, they cannot blot out Gods writing. Theſe lawes ſticke imprinted in their harts and ſoules, ſo firmely, as they cannot bee remoued. For as Paule ſaith, in the Acts. 17. <hi>God hath not left himſelfe without witneſſe, but in euery mans boſome and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ones nature, hath planted ſo much of this his law, as will ſerue to leaue them without excuſe, and to condemne them.</hi> For who is there among the moſt prophane and abſurde of men, whoſe ſoule doth not conſtraine him euen againſt his will ſometimes, to confeſſe that there is a God, and one onely true God, and that this God is to be worſhipped alſo, ſo as is moſt pleaſing to him, and that hee is not to bee blaſphemed, nor his name to bee abuſed, but that hee is to bee reuerenced, and ſometimes to be ſet a part and conſecrated to his worſhip who can blurre out theſe lawes out of themſelues? doe they what they can and, ſtriue they neuer ſo much to choke theſe ſeedes of knowledge. So for the ſecond table, of them, what mans nature doth not tell him, that there is an order of gouernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, which muſt not, nor cannot, without ſinne bee viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo heathen and prophane vngodly men, hauing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted murdure, were not able to ſtand before the furie of their owne conſcience, but were in a continuall chaſe &amp; vexation, which ſhews that euen corrupt nature bringeth with it, this knowledge into the world, that one muſt not kill. And for filthie perſons and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, though in time of their proſperitie, they haue ſoothed vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and hardened their owne harts, by liuing in pleaſure, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing themſelues to idleneſſe, and the luſts of their hearts, and ſo ſeemed to blot out this law, yet in miſery when any affliction hath wakened their drowſie harts, and conſciences, theſe would giue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29174:10"/> them no reſt nor they durſt not abide the face of their owne conſcience, but are driuen to acknowledge the filthineſſe of their ſinnes. Beſides this place that they haue in mans nature, which proueth they came from God, mans Lord. This alſo proues them to be his, becauſe all the puniſhments that are at any time inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the world, haue come from the diſobedience againſt this law, and all the bleſsings and benefites that men enjoy, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the diſobedience yeelded to it. For when God ſets downe his curſes and his bleſsings, are they not all grounded on this law? doth it not runne thus, if thou obſerue and keepe this law then thou ſhalt bee bleſſed in ſoule, in bodie, in children, in cattell, in field, in all things thou putteſt thine hand vnto. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if thou wilt not obey, but neglecteſt theſe, then ſhalt thou bee curſed in bodie, in ſoule, in children, in all thou putſt thine hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. So that ſith God hath ſo great care to puniſh thoſe that rebell againſt theſe lawes, and to reward thoſe that performe obedience to them, it proues that hee is the lawmaker, and that though the law be briefe in words, yet it is full of matter, and much to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and thought on.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſt himſelfe came into the world, to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to theſe lawes. For they require a perfect and abſolute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as they are perfect, which ſith no man could doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt tooke our fleſh vpon him to fufill them, that as Adam by his diſobedience had caſt vs out of Paradiſe, ſo hee by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience might let vs into heauen, and hee came not onely to obey them himſelfe fully, but alſo to make his Saints able to obey them to, though not in perfection and without any defect, (for that onely hee himſelfe can doe) yet in truth and perfect ſinceritie: for that he requires all his children &amp; members to doe. So that theſe reaſons will confirme that which was ſaid before, that the ten commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee after a perculiar ſort the words of God, and doe more peculiarly challenge him for their author.</p>
                  <p>The vſe that wee muſt make of this to our ſelues, is to teach vs, firſt to hearken vnto them, and willingly to heere the rebukes and admonitions, that are contained in them, whoſoeuer and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee bee that applies them and ſpeakes them vnto. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hence we ſhall ſhew our ſelues in truth, to beleeue that God
<pb facs="tcp:29174:11"/> is the author of theſe words, if we can be content to beare, that theſe precepts ſhould be preſt and vrged vpon vs, though by one that is our inferiour and baſer in outward reſpect, then our ſelues. And this affection was in <hi>Iob,</hi> as he teſtifieth of himſelfe in his 31. <hi>Chap. 34. ver.</hi> That though he was a man of ſuch wealth and authoritie, as he could haue made afrayde a great multitude, and could haue cruſht them by his power, yet the pooreſt and moſt contemtible of his familie, might haue dealt with him, and if hee had ſeene any fault in him (as vvho liues ſo iuſtly but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe that bee about may ſee infirmities in him,) and had come to tell him that he had broken the law of God, he would haue bene quiet and milde, and vvould haue bene ſo farre from fearing them vvith bigge vvords as that himſelfe vvould feare beefore GOD, and labour to get pardon, hee vvould not chafe vvith his ſeruants that had brought Gods law to him, and ſayde vvhat haſt thou to doe to meddle vvith mee, vvho gaue thee authoritie to controle thy maſter, but hee vvould controle himſelfe, and vvould not goe out of his dores to complaine of his ſeruants injurie, but hee vvould complaine to God of him ſelfe that had broken his Law, and done injurie to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.</p>
                  <p>The like may vvee ſee in that holy man <hi>Dauid,</hi> vvho though hee vvas a King annointed at Gods appointment, and one of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent guifts, a valiant vvarriour, and had foure hundred men vvel appointed vvayting on him, yet vvhen <hi>Abigail</hi> a vvoman and meane in compariſon of him, came alone, and brought vvith her the ſword of the ſpirit the law of GOD, that it vvas not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to commit murder, and to reuenge his owne cauſe. What though <hi>Nabal</hi> had done injurie, ſhe denies not but hee vvas as his name ſignified, a foole, and the foole had done foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhlie, that vvas not the queſtion though, but this ſhe vvould know of <hi>Dauid,</hi> vvhether hee might lawfully kill one in his owne priuate reuenge contrarie to the law of of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Now vvhen <hi>Dauid</hi> ſees that ſhe comes ſo vvell appointed and brings ſuch ſtrong reaſons, and that hee could not ruſh on <hi>Nabals</hi> bloud but hee ſhould ruſh vpon the ſword of GOD, and God vvould plague him: he vvould none, but leaues of, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29174:11"/> thanks her for her good counſel. So that vvhen ſhe brought the law of GOD for her vvarrant, this vvas ſo good a vvarrant, as that <hi>Dauid</hi> durſt not but yelde to it, though he vvas a King and a Prophet, and a man of moſt excellent guifts euery vvay, and ſhe but a vvoman, and farre his inferiour in graces.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this vvas the ſpirit of vvicked <hi>Amaziah,</hi> that vvhen hee moſt abſurdly, had (hauing chaſed the <hi>Edomits</hi>) taken their gods and vvorſhipped them, and ſet them vp as meanes to help him in the ſeruice of GOD, and God ſent the Prophet to him to tell him that he had dealt fooliſhly to vvorſhip thoſe gods that could not ſaue their owne people out of his hands, vvhy he now, could not beare this but begins to mock, vvho ſaith hee, I pray you, made you of the Kings counſell, are you become a counſellour now to tell the King vvhat he hath to doe, goe to, hold your peace leaſt you be ſmitten for your paynes.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet ſees him to deſpiſe the rebuke of God, and then he vvould not beſtow ſo much coſt as to giue him any more admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition on him, but vvell ſaith hee, I vvill hold my peace as you bid mee, but know that thou ſhalt ſurely periſh becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and not hearkened to my counſell, though it vvas fooliſh and naught in him to doe that thing, yet if hee could haue hearkened to the Prophet of GOD bringing the law of GOD, hee had beene on the mending hand, and all vvould haue beene vvell, but vvhen hee vvould doe ſinfully and then refuſe to bee admoniſhed, then in truth he muſt needes bee deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo hee vvas ſhortly after, moſt fearefully and ſtrangely by the hand GOD, and neither his kingdome nor his vvealth nor any thing could keepe off the iudgement of GOD and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from him.</p>
                  <p>So then vvill vvee ſhew that vvee doe in truth beeleeue that theſe bee the vvords of GOD, vvee muſt vvhen any man ſhall preſſe any of theſe lawes vnto vs, ſtraight vvaies yeeld and ſtoup vnto them, and vvee doe then confeſſe that GOD ſpake all theſe vvords, but if one begin to ſhift and cloake and colour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, then hee declares euidently that his hart is not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God is the author of theſe lawes.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:12"/>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe that wee muſt make of this, that God ſpake all theſe words is, that therefore wee muſt not be afraide nor aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſtande for them, and defend them, as alſo to practiſe them in our liues, though the Atheiſts and the prophane ſwine of the world, mock and ſcoffe at vs neuer ſo much for the ſame. For what neede we be aſhamed to maintaine thoſe wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was not aſhamed in his owne perſon to ſpeake. If we doe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>hee that is aſhamed of mee, before men in this world, I will bee aſhamed of him, before my father in the world to come.</hi> If God had but ſent his Angels vnto vs, with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, the gloriouſneſſe of ſuch meſſengers, ſhould haue might to make vs bolde to defend and ſtand for the meſſage, but ſith God did not ſend an hoaſt of Angels, but came himſelfe in his Mageſtie, accompanied with all his holy Angels, attending and waiting one him, ſhould wee not now giue much more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe things which hee ſpake, and take much more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to ſtande for the maintenance of his commandements?</p>
                  <p>This ſerues therefore exceedingly to condemne their daſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, that are afraide to keepe the ſabboth, or to doe any ſuch duty, becauſe they ſhould be counted puritanes. But is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that men ſhould hate vs without cauſe, then that God ſhould haue a quarrell againſt vs, vpon a iuſt cauſe, is not it much better that they ſhould ſcoffe at vs for good, then that God ſhould plague vs for euill. What a ſhame is it for vs therefore, that when we he are wicked heretiques, ſpeaking againſt the law of God, and prophane Atheiſts breaking his law, and blaſpheming his name, wee ſhould plucke in our hornes and become mute, as though it were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome great diſcredit for vs, to ſpeake for that, which God himſelfe in his owne perſon, hath ſpoken vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſerues to proue this law to bee ſpirituall, for ſuch an one as God is, which made the law, ſuch an one is that law which hee made, it reacheth therefore to the inward hart of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and lies cloſe vpon his conſcience. And indeede in this it doth eſpecially differ from the lawes of men. For they doe tye the tongue, and the hand, and the foote to the good vpbearance, and take notice if any oft; this bee faulty againſt them, but they meddle not with the hart, and make no queſtion of the inward
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29174:12"/> motions of the ſoule, becauſe man can bring in no proofe of the breach of ſuch a law, nor can haue no, witneſſe of ſuch faults.</p>
                  <p>But God ſearcheth the hart, and tryeth the reynes, &amp; entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecrets of the ſoule: and therefore he commands to loue him with all our hart and with all our ſoule; not contented vvith ſuch a loue onely, as is declared by the outward behauiour of the bodie. And ſo for our neighbour he commands euery one to loue his neighbour as him ſelfe; now we know that men do loue them ſelues with a deepe and inward loue, not outwardly onely in ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and courteſie and good ſpeaches, but euery man loues him ſelfe in trueth with a good meaning and in good earneſt, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblingly. So muſt all the obedience performed to God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from vvithin and come from the hart, elſe it ſhould be no vvhit acceptable to him, that that growes without, if it come not from the root of vprightneſſe and ſinceritie within, ſhall afford no comfort to our ſelues, but if wee will that our outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhall bring any fruit to our owne ſoules or glory to God, we muſt looke, that it haue it beginning from an vpright, &amp; ſound and faithfull hart. Now, then our obedience ſhalbe ſpiritual, when firſt it procedeth from the ſoule; and ſecondly, if it be done with a good intent and to a good end, but if we doe ſome things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for credit, or elſe for merit as the Papiſts, or for vaineglorie, as the ſcribes and phariſes did, this is not ſpirituall, this procedeth not from the loue of God, but from ſelfe loue, this is a reflecting kinde of friendſhip, that makes one doe ſome one or other thing vnto an other that he may haue the like or ſome other thing done vnto him ſelfe. But then is our obedience true and vpright vvhen it commeth from a good hart, with deſire &amp; purpoſe to ſhew our obedience to God and our loue to men.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>All theſe Words.</head>
                  <p>GOD ſpake not the firſt commandement onely nor the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third and left there, but he ſpake them all, and gaue as great and ſtrict a charge to keepe euery one as any one, and no one was vttered more by Gods voyce or written with his owne
<pb facs="tcp:29174:13"/> ſinger one then other. The doctrine that ariſeth hence, that whoſoeuer will haue any true comfort by his obedience to Gods law, muſt not content himſelfe to looke to one or two, but muſt make conſcience and haue a care to keepe them all, and euery one firſt, becauſe he that is the author of one, is the author alſo of all the reſt, and hee that hath promiſed a reward for keeping one, hath promiſed a rewarde alſo for keeping all, and he that threatneth to puniſh the offender, doth not ſay, if thou breake this or that, thou ſhalt bee curſed, but hee that continueth not in all without exception, is accurſed, and liuing and allowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the breach of any one, ſhall bee ſure to beare the wrath of God: for hee that doth many good things, yet allowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but to be diſobedient in any one thing, hee ſtands in danger to reuolt continually, and to become a wicked and open perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor. As this was <hi>Herods</hi> caſe, hee did many things according to <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching, and did heare him gladly, and for all the other nine was reaſonable willing to bee ruled: but for the ſeauenth there hee muſt needs haue a gappe, and hee kept this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that let all the preachers in the world ſay what they would, hee would not bee brought to leaue his inceſt, but would ſtill keepe his brothers wife. Therefore wee ſee how ſoone hee fell to breake firſt the third commaundement, in ſwearing to that light huſwife, to giue her what euer ſhe ſhould aske, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee grew to perſecute <hi>Iohn,</hi> and cut off his head, and when he had once taken leaue, to breake the ſeauenth, hee could not long ſticke at the reſt.</p>
                  <p>So the young man in the Goſpell, hee thought himſelfe in a good forwardneſſe to heauen, and indeede hee had done many things, and had many good parts in him, ſo that Chriſt himſelfe did loue him, but when Chriſt had tolde him one thing was lacking, and that hee muſt ſell all that hee had, and if hee did ſo hee ſhould bee no leeſer by the bargaine, for hee ſhould haue an inheritaunce, but then hee muſt know where his inheritaunce ſhould lye, and whence hee muſt looke for his reuenues, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from heauen, then hee looked ſadly, and went his way. Hee could haue beene content to haue had that inheritaunce that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29174:13"/> Chriſt ſpake of, ſo that hee might keepe his earthly inheritance to. But if the queſtion were, whether hee would take heauen or earth? hee would rather leaue Heauen, then hee would part with earth: ſo that hee that is hollow, is alwaies in danger to backeſlide.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith in his ſecond Chapter, and tenth verſe. <hi>Hee that keepes all, and breakes one is guiltie of all,</hi> not meaning that if one through infirmitie ſlip into any fault, hee was ſtraight way guiltie of the whole Law, for ſo it may bee truely ſaide, that hee that breakes all through weakeneſſe, not allowing himſelfe in it, but ſtriuing againſt it, and crauing pardon, is guiltie of none, but this hee meanes, that whoſoeuer ſeemes to keepe all the other commandements, yet will willingly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and beare with him ſelfe in the breach of one, hee did neuer performe any true obedience to any, though one bee no theefe, yet if hee bee an adulterer, or though hee bee no adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, yet if hee bee a Saboth breaker, hee breakes the whole law. For if one aske him, why doe not you commit adulterie? if hee ſay, becauſe God commands that I ſhould not, then hee would keepe the Saboth alſo, for they bee both alike the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, but if it bee not becauſe God commands, then hee doth not obey the law, but ſerue himſelfe. Therefore hee that makes no conſcience of all Gods lawes, hath no ſoundneſſe and fidelitie in him, becauſe hee doth not remember that God ſpake all theſe words.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this, is firſt to confute Popiſh religion, and to proue that they be altogether carnall and ſinfull people, and make no conſcience of any law of God. Becauſe for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement, they doth wholy allow themſelues to breake that, for the ſcope and ſumme of that commandement is, that we ſhould ſerue God, not according to our owne inuentions, but according to his commandement, but for their religion, what is it? but a meere deuice of mens braines, and what doth it conſiſt of? but of the precepts of men. For where doth the word of God teach them to make Images, lay mens bookes, nay doth not God directly call them teachers of lies: and what warran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:29174:14"/> haue they for their Maſſes and pilgrimages and ſuch other ſtuffe whereof their religion doth depend. Therefore they bee hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and make no conſcience of any of Gods commandements. And moſt of them that be any thing deuout Papiſts make no care of the Sabboth, but haue more regard of their idle holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes vvhich the Pope hath appointed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sabboth day vvhich God hath appointed. So far moſt carnall profeſſours amongſt vs, vvho almoſt is there that regards the Sabboth and careth to breake it, any further then the law of man will take hold of them, and ſome be afrayde leaſt if it be knowne they ſhalbe reproued for it publiquely, and the Miniſter will let them heare of it in the Church, but if they could keepe themſelues cloſe from the Magiſtrate and Miniſter, vvould not moſt men vvillingly be following their buſineſſe that day.</p>
                  <p>This is to proclayme themſelues hipocrites and that they haue no feare of God nor regard of him in their hartes. O but they hope they are good Chriſtians and doe keepe the law of God, for they doe not ſteale nor ſweare nor lye, but doe they not know that God ſpake all theſe words, and therefore he hath no ſound hart to God that ſettles not himſelfe to keepe them all.</p>
                  <p>This muſt alſo teach vs, when we ſee that God doth not bleſſe vs according to his promiſes to thoſe that feare him, then we muſt examine our ſelues diligently concerning our obedience to this his law, whether we liue not in ſome ſinne, or whether ſome olde ſinne lye not in vs which hath neuer bene repented, for certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all Gods plagues that he layes vpon vs for our neglect of this his law, wherefore when he ſtrikes vs we muſt begin to looke to our obedience.</p>
                  <p>So did <hi>Iacob</hi> in Geneſis: when his ſonnes <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leuie</hi> had committed that cruell fact and he was therefore made odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of the people of the land, then he knowes that there could not be ſuch trouble without if all were well within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he begins to ſearch his family and to ſee how all things went there, and then he perceues preſently the cauſe of all theſe ſtirres, for his houſe was full of Idolatry, his wife had gotten his father in lawes Idols, and many of his people fell from the pure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29174:14"/> worſhip of God to abhominable ſuperſtition, then no wonder if ther were ſuch ſturres without when ther was ſuch diſorder with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, therfore he purgeth his houſe of all this filthineſſe, and buries all theſe Idolls in the ground that they might neuer hurt him or any of his any more. All this ſerues for the ſinguler comfort of all Gods children: that ſeeth theſe be Gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts all as well as one, therefore they ſhall haue power alſo to obey them all as well as one, for that God which gaue vs power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey one can giue vs the like power to obey the reſt, and that power which any hath to obey one, tis not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe but from the work of God in him.</p>
                  <p>And indeed God doth not giue vs theſe lawes that we ſhould imagine we could obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, but that ſeeing our owne wants we might goe to him for help, why then ſhould not euery chriſtian hope to be able to yeeld obedience to God, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God commandeth him. As God witneſſeth this of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> that he was a man after Gods owne hart, in all things but in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> he neuer ſinned preſumptuouſly but then, his hart was vpright in all things elſe, and likewiſe as it is ſpoken of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that they were perfect and vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all things, not that they were quit from all infirmities, or had not their faults as well as any other, but they were vpright and ſincere, their hart was true with God, and ſo God can and will giue grace vnto all his to obey euery one of his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements with a true and vpright obedience. So that no man ought to diſcharge himſelfe. Oh, for other things I haue ſome hope: I, that I ſhall ouercome them, but for this or that ſinne I ſhall neuer get the better of that while I liue. Well then for other ſinnes you hope you can ouercome them, but this is the point then, vvhether haue you power to ſubdue them by any vertue of your owne, or elſe from the vvorking of Gods ſpirit in you? If you ſay from your ſelfe, then you ſpeake ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fooliſhly, for fleſh cannot kill any ſinne, this muſt be the vvork onely of God. I but Chriſt Ieſus did giue help to mee againſt thoſe, but for this one thing I doubt: &amp; vvhy ſhould you doubt. Hee that gaue you abilitie to ouerrule your fleſh in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:29174:15"/> things, cannot he giue the like in all? Yea, this very mercy, that he gaue you a diſpoſition and power to obey him in one thing, is a ſure teſtimony to you that he vvill doe the like for all, onely if you aſke it you neede not doubt.</p>
                  <p>So that this vvhich he ſaith, <hi>GOD spake all theſe words,</hi> is a merueylous incouragement to the Saincts, therefore feeling their vvants in any, they may goe to God and ſaie Lord, thou art the author of all theſe Commandements a like, and the keeping of them all pertaines vnto mee as well as to any other, but thou knoweſt O Lord that there is no power in mee to obey the leaſt of them, therefore I come now for power from thee, to make mee obedient: and hence he ſhall haue power to keepe all as well as any one.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words ſignifies the eſſence of God and his abſolute perfection in all his attributes. It is expounded in the 13. of the Hebr. and 8. ver. <hi>Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for euer.</hi> And Reuel. 1. <hi>He that was, and is, and is to come:</hi> He that is the ſelfe ſame in all his properties. It ſignifies firſt Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in vvhich he differs from all creatures, for men and Angels are euerlaſting, they ſhall haue no ending, but they be not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, for they had their beginning from God, but he hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and of himſelfe, neither had he any beginning from any other: all other things had beginning from him, but he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none, he is from himſelfe alone. Alſo power and wiſdome and mercie and Iuſtice and ſuch other things which are properties in men and Angels, in him they are natures, in vs they are weake and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but in him endleſſe and perfect. As in Exod. 34. Where he tells his name, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, mercifull, gracious,</hi> &amp;c. Men and Angels are ſtrong, but this is a qualitie in them, in him a nature, ſo men and Angels are kinde, but this is deriued from his kindeneſſe &amp; is a qualitie in them, but in him a nature, &amp; in them finite becauſe no creature can haue any infinite thing in himſelfe, but in God they are infinit. So that it ſignifies that God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29174:15"/> is eternall and hath his being from himſelfe, and other creatures haue their being and beginning from him. In him power, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Iuſtice, &amp;c. are infinite, in others they are finite: In him they be natures and therefore vnchangeable, in others qualities and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mutable.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this muſt be to make vs earneſt to ſeeke his loue and fauour, which if wee haue, nothing can hurt vs, for in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being. Hauing his loue, we haue all power, all wisdome, and all counſell, on our ſide. If he be perfect in himſelfe, and all creatures haue what euer they haue from him, what neede we feare he being with vs, what all the creatures can doe againſt vs, being that all their power is deriued from him and vſed at his direction. Wee ſee among men, if there be one whoſe eſtate depends wholly vpon his landlords curteſie, he may put him out, and begger him when he pleaſe, how carefull is hee to pleaſe him and haue his fauour, leaſt through his diſpleaſure hee ſhould be turned out of all. So is it with all the men on earth, they be all Gods tenants, &amp; that at will, no man holds any thing by leaſe for an houre, our breath is not our owne, but his: it is at his diſcretion what ſhall become of our ſoules and bodies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhalbe ſaued or damned, and he is ſuch a God whoſe anger is an eternall anger, and his vvrath an eternall vvrath, and his plagues euerlaſting plagues, how carefull and diligent ſhould vvee bee to pleaſe and obey him. And then vve ſhew our ſelues to beeleeue his power and infiniteneſſe, vvhen it is our greateſt care to ſeeke his fauour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is for the conſolation of Gods children, Is God the ſame for euer and that in his dealing to his children, and hath hee heretofore vſed his power for their defence, his vvisdome for their direction, his mercie for their comfort? then hee vvill doe the ſame ſtill to vs alſo. Therefore vvhen any of his children haue bene brought into great miſerie, and that for their ſinne as Manaſſeh he vvas brought to that hard caſe for his great ſinne and vvicked deedes, yet vvhen hee repented and beetooke him ſelfe to prayer, vvee ſee God heard him &amp; helped
<pb facs="tcp:29174:16"/> him out both of his ſinne and his miſerie. Did he deale ſo with him, then the queſtion is, whether he be <hi>Iehouah,</hi> or not, whether the ſame for euer without any chaunge? If he be, as ſure hee is, then hee muſt deliuer vs alſo, when we call vpon him. But I am ſure to be deliuered out of this priſon, and to bee ſet out of this debt, or temptation, if I call vnto God. This I am ſure of, that if I cry to God, hee will deliuer me from my ſinne, and if it bee good for mee then alſo from the puniſhment of my ſinne, but if the curſe doe remayne one ſtill, hee will recompence it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirituall bleſsings.</p>
                  <p>But vnleſſe we beleeue that God is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then all the ſtories of the ſcripture, are made vnprofitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then we haue no vſe nor comfort of thoſe things, which we heare reade, how God heard <hi>Abraham,</hi> and how hee deliuered <hi>Iacob,</hi> and did many wonderfull thinges for his people in former time. But if wee holde this for ſure, God is the ſame for euer, then this is ſure that whatſoeuer good thing, he did for them, hee will doe the like for vs, if we vſe the ſame meanes. So alſo if any one hath found in himſelfe, that at ſuch time, I was in great trouble and temptation, and then I prayed vnto God, and I know that hee heard my prayer, and helped me. Are you ſure that God did heare you when you cried, then you are farre more ſure of this, that if you cry againe, hee will heare you againe, elſe hee ſhould not bee <hi>Iehouah:</hi> If hee haue beene yours, he is yours, and will bee for euer.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo for the terror of the wicked, is God <hi>Iehouah,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and vnchangeable in all his iudgements? Why then looke what plagues proude perſons haue had heeretofore, the ſame ſhall they now haue, ſo ſure as God is true, vnleſſe they repent, and get pardon in Chriſt. Hath God plagued theeues, and filthy lyers, &amp; Saboth breakers in former times: He is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> let them looke to it, it is his name &amp; nature to hate and plague them that bee ſuch euerlaſtingly, leaſt there bee repentance on their part and pardon on his. Likewiſe can any man ſay by experience I fell into ſinne heeretofore, and then I got a wound to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a blot to my name, and hurt to my body: why then as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29174:16"/> ſure as the Lord liues, as ſure as God is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> without change; ſo ſure make account to ſpeed as ill in ſinning now as you did before. Many that did ſteale before and were brought to ſhame and could ſcarce ſaue their liues, yet when they are deliuered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will fall to it againe, but more cloſely as they thinke, they will bee more skil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in their trade, and bee more ſecret, and then all ſhall be well. But who found them out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? was not that a iuſt judgement from God? that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to wicked men according to their wickedneſſe: then be ſure that ſeeth he hath once ſhewed his power, and gaue them both by weale and woe, meanes to bring them to repentance, hee is the ſame. Who will thinke to fall into former ſinnes, and yet haue better ſucceſſe; for it cannot be but God is the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; both muſt &amp; can puniſh them. So ſome haue plaied the filthie perſons &amp; God hath ſhewed it to men, to their diſcredit, will they then fall to it again, &amp; thinke they can hide it, no they ſhall not, for God will reueale it: though they may think God will be careleſſe of them, yet hee will not be careleſſe of himſelfe and his name. As ſure as hee is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that brought them through the pikes before, ſo ſure if they turne againe to their filthie vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, he will bring them to ſhame againe, either in this life, or if not in this life, to make them repent and iudge themſelues, then ſure in the life to come, wher the burden ſhall bee much more heauy &amp; vnſupportable vpon their conſcience, &amp; ſhall preſſe them down to hell. For the beſt priuiledge for ſuch ſinners, is to come to ſhame heere, that if it may be, they may be brought to repentance &amp; amendement. So much for the name of God, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> that is without change or ſhadow of change, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee hath done, hee will doe for euer.</p>

                  <p>THe former argument of obedience, was taken from Gods nature, that hee was eternall in iuſtice to puniſh ſinners, &amp; in mercy to reward his children. Now this is from his goodneſſe, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> ſo almightie, infinit, eternall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:17"/> as that I abaſe my ſelfe to take care for thee, to haue a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hart to thee, and to be thy father, if thou wilt be my child, to be thine husband, if thou wilt be my ſpouſe, one that haue promiſed to giue thee all good things, and to remoue all ill things from thee, this is, to be thy God. If God had ſet down onely his infinite mageſtie, and greatneſſe, and his glorious, and incommunicable name, that would haue feared vs, and made vs flie from him. But now hee encourageth vs, by this that hee is our God, and giues vs theſe commandements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loues vs.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine hence gathered is: that if euer wee will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God in ſoundneſſe, then wee muſt know him to bee our God, to beare a care of vs, to loue vs, and that we ſhall ſpeede better by obeying him, then by breaking his commandements. And this reaſon <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill vrgeth vpon thee Iſrael, thou muſt obey him, &amp; heare his voyce, for he is the Lord thy God, that loues thee, and careth for thee. Reaſon will ſhew this: for if we heare that God is infinit in power, and doe not withall know that he is our God, to vſe his power for our good, then it maks vs feare, becauſe we know not wher to hide our ſelues from him, when we heare his infinit iuſtice, we quake and tremble, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vexeth the theefe more then to heare of a iuſt iudge, for then he hath no hope of eſcaping, vnleſſe he haue a pardon, &amp; know that the iudge comes to deliuer him, &amp; to doe him good. Alſo when we heare of gods goodnes, and patience, and mercy, this will bee but a vexation to vs vnleſſe wee know that he bee good &amp; mercifull to vs. This addes to the griefe, to heare that God is good, if we muſt not feele it, for then the wicked hart obiects thus: they keepe a preching that god is good, mercifull, gratious, &amp; I know not what, but what is this to me, that he is ſo to others? I am ſure he is not ſo to mee, I muſt goe the broader way, his mercy is ſhut againſt me. This vexeth the guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to heare that ſuch good things be laid vp in ſtore for gods children, but he muſt taſt of none of them. As for a poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly fellow, that hath nothing, to heare tel of large poſſeſſions, &amp; great reuenues that muſt be left to ſuch, &amp; ſuch an one. This
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29174:17"/> is a tedious anguiſh vnto him, &amp; makes his miſery more bitter. So that nothing can moue or alure vs to obey God, til we know that he is good to vs, &amp; will giue vs ſaluation. The vſe of this is, that would we euer yeeld any cheerefull obedience to God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs feele the truth of that which God ſpeakes, that hee is our God, our ſauiour, &amp; hath done more for vs then any other can, &amp; therfore we will obey him aboue all. To this intent then we muſt examine our ſelues, whether God hath wrought thoſe things in vs, which he doth in thoſe, whoſe God he is. As firſt for God the father, he regenerates vs, &amp; begets vs a new by the word of truth, try then whether we haue this note in vs or not. Doth the word of god abide in vs, are we begotten a new, hath the ſeede of immortalitie, made vs new creatures, &amp; begun to work immortality in vs, then conclude, ſure God is our God. Secondly God ſheds his loue abroad in the harts of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and makes them cry <hi>Abba</hi> father. This is not ſo in men, they when they beget a ſonne cannot beget a child-like affection in him but often children be rebellious &amp; ſtubborne. But if God beget a child to himſelf by the ſeed of his word, he makes him haue an affection to him as to a father, if then we haue this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God, that we loue him as our father, certainely this is his work, &amp; we are his children. Alſo God the ſon Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, wher he comes, he kils ſin, he abates our luſt &amp; worldlines, &amp; works a freſh ſpring of grace &amp; holines. But if we feele no working of his death in vs, to mortifie our ſinne, then how can we know that he dyed for vs. If the power of his reſurrection haue had no effect in vs for our ſanctifying, how can we beleeue that he did riſe againe for vs. So for God the holy ghoſt, wher it comes, it conuinceth the world of ſinne. Afore a man can ſay much, for his ſin he can defend, &amp; hath with to ſay many things for it, &amp; will hold vp his head in maintenance of it. But when Gods ſpirit enters into the hart once, that ſets one downe, and makes him he cannot looke vp, till he haue confeſſed his ſin, &amp; craued pardon, &amp; ben aſhamed of it throughly. But many men ther be, that would be thought to haue Gods ſpirit, yet will not bee reprooued, but that is veryfied of them that is ſpoken
<pb facs="tcp:29174:18"/> of the foole in the Prouerbs, <hi>Bray a foole in a morter, as Wheat is brayed with a Peſtile, yet will not he depart from his folly.</hi> They will maintaine it, and ſtand for it, and therefore it muſt needes bee, muſt practiſe it.</p>
                  <p>But if Gods ſpirit reproue one, &amp; if he haue ſinned it check him, and make him feare, bleſſed is he, for God is his God. Oh, but I am more feared and troubled now, then I was before. True, and it muſt be ſotfor Gods ſpirit, where it takes place muſt needs conuince and condemne one of ſinne. For tis not as many thinke, a matter of wit, to ſtand in defence of ſinne, and to be able to ſpeake for a bad thing, but tis a matter of luſt, for where luſt hath dominion, it whettens the witte to ſpeake for it, and the diuell helps, but if Gods ſpirit come once that driues to a plaine confeſsion, it caſts downe Sathans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and then luſt rules the wit no more. Alſo the fruits of the ſpirit are Patience, Meekeneſſe, Modeſtie, Loue, and Chaſtitie, then let one try himſelfe in theſe things, not for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtrength, for a Bull &amp; Lyon are ſtronger then man, and other beaſts to, but if one haue patience and gentleneſſe and a moderate ſpirit, to adorne his minde, theſe be ſure ſignes of gods ſpirit. Alſo the holy Ghoſt makes vs able to cry <hi>Abba</hi> father, it makes vs able to breath out our requeſts vnto God, and to powre out our ſupplications before the moſt high, if we haue this ſpirit of prayer, then it is plaine, the holy Ghoſt, is ours. So that if God haue regenerated vs, and Chriſt haue killed our ſinnes, &amp; the holy ghoſt make vs aſhamed of them, &amp; confeſſe them, and it worke in vs Loue &amp; Patience and moderation of our affections, and make vs able to pray vnto God, then God is our God, and then this will make vs obey, but if this be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all is ſhaken, this is the foundation of obedience. But men will ſay, that they haue a faith, &amp; beleeue in God, which if they had it would bring forth obedience, &amp; haue works, for how can one chuſe but ſtriue to obey God, if they holde this for ſure, that God loues him, &amp; regards him, &amp; will giue him a reward for euery good thing that hee doth, and this euery one muſt hold that will ſay, God is his God.</p>

                  <p>NOW hee proues himſelfe to be their God, becauſe hee had done ſo wonderfull things for them, from their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous deliuerance, that though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all Aegipt was againſt them, though the Sea and the wilderneſſe reſiſted, and which was worſt of all, their owne vnbeleefe: yet God brake through all, and ſet them free. Hence this doctrine is gathered. That whatſoeuer miſery Gods children be in, yet God vvill deliuer them: For this is not written for them but for vs.</p>
                  <p>They were vnder a long and ſtrong affliction, for foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres ſpace, almoſt vnder a tyrant, that whipt their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſcourged them, and put them to labour aboue their ſtrength, and which was a moſt intollerable vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made the parents drowne their owne children: None euer entreated any ſo ſpightfully as they were vſed, yet we ſee god deliuered them. So in the Pſalme he ſaith, <hi>Many bee the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who ſhall deliuer them:</hi> not their wealth and mony, for of that they are bare enough often times, nor friends, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they haue none, nor ſtrength, for they be weakned oft, and brought low enough. But God will deliuer them, let one get righteouſneſſe and faith, and the ſpirit of prayer, though they vvere in an iron furnace vnder <hi>Paraohs</hi> tyrannie, in an houſe of bondage: let them but cry, and from thence God will deliuer them. So in <hi>Heſters</hi> time, a wonderfull affliction it was that the day of execution was appointed, when all the godly ſhould be put to ſword, not one ſeruant of God ſhould be left aliue. But now when they could crye vnto God, and had none elſe to goe vnto but him, and him they would goe vnto, and truſt vpon him, knowing that he could help them if he would, and would alſo for his promiſe ſake deliuer them. Then wee ſee the day that was appointed to their ſorrow, turned to their ioy; that which was thought to bring deſtruction vpon them, brought deſtruction vpon their enemies; and the day of their
<pb facs="tcp:29174:19"/> moſt extreame captiuitie, proued to be the day of their moſt ioyful deliuerance, that euer they had. And it muſt needs be ſo, for els God ſhould looſe the end of his corrections, for he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to make them pertakers of his holineſſe. But if hee ſhould ſuffer them to pine away, and to eat vp their hart with griefe, this would not make them more holy, but more ſinful; and therefore he ſaith, he will not let the rod of the wicked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lie on the righteous, leaſt he put forth his hand to euill; noting that if the Godly ſhould be too much afflicted, they could not hold in, but would turne a ſide to ſin by courſes; but God will none of that; for then he ſhould miſſe of his intent. So he ſpeakes in another place. <hi>Iſa. 57. 16. That he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies chide, leaſt the ſpirit ſhould faile before him,</hi> ſhewing that if he ſhould not moderate the croſſes of his Saints, they would faint, &amp; periſh vtterly, &amp; then he ſhould be the looſer. As if when one goes to tame his colt for his vſe, he ſhould break his backe, &amp; by ſome meanes ſpoile him, the maſter ſhould looſe by that, it were no profit for him to do ſo. So when God comes to his owne elect, which are before their calling (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks) wilde aſſe coltes, vntamed, &amp; vnruly, he will maſter them, and cruſh them, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtoupe, but he wil not breake them, &amp; deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and conſume them, for then the damage were his, for he ſhould croſſe his owne purpoſe, which is to bring them to life. Therefore Gods children may be aſſured of comfort, an happie end ſhall follow an vncomfortable beginning, an happy deliuery ſhall come inſteade of an vnhappy ſeruitude.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this is, to teach vs neuer to faint vnder our croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and troubles, be they what they will be, neuer be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, God is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that can help though men will not, yea though all were againſt vs, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> &amp; the Egiptians againſt Iſraell, and none would moue the hand to help, yet his help is ſufficient to gaineſay them all. For hath God deliuered vs from ſpirituall enemies, which is the greateſt miſerie, this is the great and hard ſlauery, to be vnder the diuels yoke, to bee in bondage to filthie luſts, now hath God ſet vs at libertie from the yoake of the Diuell, ſhall hee not giue eaſe from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29174:19"/> thoſe men that preſſe our fleſh? hath hee remooued the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of ſinne which would haue damned our ſoules? and cannot hee giue vs refreſhing from the miſery of our body. If God deliuer from ſin, death, &amp; hell, neuer faint as though hee could not deliuer from outward afflictions; if he haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the greater, the leſſer ſhall not withſtand him. God did giue freedome from thoſe that be ſimply euill, as ſinne is ſimply euill, and the cauſe of all ill, then tis eaſier to ſuccour againſt thoſe which are not in themſelues and ſimply euill, but often are turned into bleſsings. Hath Chriſt waſhed vs from our ſinne, the worſt and hardeſt enemie, for all the world cannot waſh away one ſinne, then neuer feare theſe leſſer matters.</p>
                  <p>O but this makes me doubt whether I am Gods childe or not, becauſe I haue ſuch long and fiery troubles, if God loued me, would he afflict me thus? why then looke to theſe people heare, they were the beſt nation vnder the Sunne, and none ſo good as Iſraell, euen then when they were thus threſhed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pharaos cruelty. All other people were but as thornes, they were the roſe, and other were but harlots, they the Lordes ſpouſe, yet they were afflicted, &amp; indeede, to keepe them from running after Idolatry, and ſo to damnation; So that outward eaſe is no ſigne of Gods fauour, elſe none ſhould be in Gods fauour, but the Sodomits and the Cananits, for they had all the eaſe, and wealth, and outward proſperitie, and the credit and worſhip of the world. And before the floud Kaines chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had all the beautie of the world on their ſide. They found out Muſicke and keeping of Cattle, and all muſt bee beholding to them; But that is no matter, let vs keepe Gods fauour, let vs feare him and pray vnto him, and then our long and ſtrong croſſes, ſhall bring long and ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly let vs hence learne to prepare for croſſes, ſince gods children may bee ſorely afflicted, elſe little doe wee know how they will ſting vs when they doe come. It is our beſt courſe therefore to get wiſedome while the price is in our hands,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:20"/> labour to get patience, and to acquaint our ſelues with God, that we may ſeeke to him, &amp; waite for deliuerance at his hand. For that makes croſſes ſo tedious and grieuous, when they hit vs on the bare, whereas if wee had patience to beare them, and faith to emptie our harts by prayer in Gods boſome, they would be eaſie. Nothing makes croſſes burdenſome but when they meete with an heart in which remaines ſome ſinne vnrepented, or ſome paſsion vnſubdued. But if with faith and patience yeeld our ſelues vnto Gods will, wee ſhould be as quiet as lambes, as Chriſt was as a ſheepe before her ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, dumbe, &amp; anſwered not a word. So <hi>Paul</hi> in the Acts, when they perſwaded him not to goe to Ieruſalem, what doe you we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and greeuing mine hart, I am readie to dye for Chriſts ſake at Ieruſalem, he could be content to giue his skinne to be whipt, and his bodie to be impriſoned: yea, and his life alſo to be kild, for Chriſts ſake nothing could be to deare, or to much to beſtow on him. Prepare therefore for croſſes, and we ſhall be able to beare them. But if wee goe on in a fooles paradice, and think indeed this world is a vale of teares to others, but to mee it ſhalbe a place of pleaſure; they muſt haue trouble, but I muſt haue eaſe; then when inſteed of ioy, we finde griefe that wee looked not for, and we dreamed of creadit, but there comes nothing but contempt; wee imagined that God ſhould lift vs vp higher and higher, and he caſts vs downe lower and lower; this caſts one into ſuch deſperate paſsions, that he is neither fit to ſerue God nor man. All this would be helped, if wee could think gods children haue in all times ſuffered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, tis the lot of the righteous, and I muſt looke to taſt of the ſame cup, and therefore labour beforehand to get pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to truſt in God, and looke for help at his hand, then we ſhould be like <hi>Moſes</hi> that in all thoſe doings when other were at their wits end for vexation and feare, he was quiet and ſtill, and God deliuered him out of all, as he will doe vs alſo, if we will as he did patiently truſt vpon him. So much of this preface. The firſt commandement is contained in theſe words.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="commandment">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:29174:20"/>
               <head>Thou ſhalt haue none other gods before mee.</head>
               <p>THe drift of this commandement is that wee ſhould ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie God in our harts, and giue him his full priuiledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his creatures. Firſt of the negatiue part. To haue none other gods, is not to haue any thing whereon wee ſet our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or eſteeme it more then God. The doctrine from hence is that we muſt ſuffer no thing to withdraw our hart, our mind, our ſoule, our hope, or any thing in our ſoule &amp; body from God. For who ſoeuer withdraws any thing in vs from God, that is a ſtrange God vnto vs, that is euery mans God which euery man is moſt ſet vpon, what euer the minde of man is more ſet vpon &amp; buſied about then the glory &amp; ſeruice of god, that is another God. As for matter of commoditie. If one ſet his hope, and his truſt, and hart vpon his wealth, this is Idolatrie. As in <hi>Iob 31. 24. If I made gold myne hope, &amp;c.</hi> So the rich man in the goſpel, made his wealth an Idoll, becauſe he truſted in that, and did worſhip that, for here he ſpeakes of the inward worſhip of God, in ſoule. If one then relie vpon wealth, &amp; think himſelfe ſafe when he hath it, and vndone if it be taken from him, this is to make his goods his God, gold is his hope. For if his hope be gone with his gold, what was his hope before? If when his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches depart, his confidence alſo departed. Did not he ſay to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afore, thou art my confidence. So, couetouſneſſe is called Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, not that men bow downe their bodies to worſhip it: But which is worſe, their ſoules and affections, their wit and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp; vnderſtanding, &amp; all their faculties ſtoope to that, which ſhould onely ſtoupe to God. So that hee that loues his riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue meaſure, and ſets his hart vpon earthly things, is one of the worſt ſort of Idolaters. So if one ſet his hart vpon pleaſure, what euer thing it is, that he hunts after, more then gods glory, this is an other God to him. As the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome that did make their belly their god: they would haue thought it an injury if one had come &amp; told them that they worſhiped not God, but their belly, for they profeſſe religion and to ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:29174:21"/> God, as well as the beſt. Yet the Apoſtle ſaith in plaine words, they made their belly their god: for though that they did not kneele downe and hold vp their hands to their belly, yet they ſet themſelues more earneſtly to feed their body, then to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and were more grieued if they were pinched in a matter of vittaile &amp; good cheere, then to ſee the name of God diſhonored and blaſphemed, &amp; any ſinne committed. So thoſe that ſet their whole ſelues to hunting, hawking, dicing, carding, gaming, whoring, or any ſuch vilde practiſe, they make theſe things their god: for they are more glad &amp; more rejoyce when thoſe things are effected according to their deſire, then if any thing be brought to paſſe for Gods honour, &amp; if they be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any of theſe things, they are more vext and troubled with it, then for ſwearing, or ſtealing, or breach of the Saboth, or lying, or any thing whereby Gods law is violated; theſe filthie monſters then be worſhipers of falſe gods, and make theſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie things Idolls to themſelues. So <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> 17. cha. 5. ver. To make fleſh ones arme, is Idolatrie, that is, to truſt in any fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, for faith he, curſed be he that makes fleſh his arme. Why may he not doe ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſerue God to? No, ſaith hee, but withdrawes his hart from God, ſo that looke how much any one rely vpon any fleſhly things, things, ſo much he forſakes God, and in what meaſure he pleaſeth his confidence in any thing elſe, in that meaſure he diſplaſeth it from God. So <hi>Eli</hi> was ſaid to honour his ſonnes more then God. Though he were a good &amp; holy man, yet, being to indulgent to his children, in that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe onely to haue admoniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thoſe faults, and did not procede to puniſh them according to their fault, when admonition would not ſerue the turne; becauſe he was a magiſtrate, in that he had not ſuch a zeale of Gods glory, and of the breach of Gods law, as to puniſh his children for it: he honored them more then God. But that he did honor God, &amp; was a good man, but through infirmitie and to much loue of his children, he was borne away from that care of the glory of God, that he ſhould haue had, &amp; ſo did beare with them more then he ought to haue done, and this was that ſinne for which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29174:21"/> God did both in word reproue him, and in deede alſo correct him with ſo great a puniſhment: this was to diſhonour God.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this is, firſt to confute all ignorant men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all vnregenerate men and women, it is certaine, they haue other gods: for euery vnregenerate man depends either vpon himſelfe or ſome other thing elſe, neuer vpon God, as he ſaith of ſuch, they ſacrifice vnto their nets, not that they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer burnt offerings vnto them, but becauſe they got much wealth by fiſhing, they thought their riches came from that, &amp; therfore imagined that God did not prouide for them, but that they had prouided for themſelues, and ſo did not giue thanks vnto God, but vnto their owne ſkill and wit, that could finde meanes how to get theſe outward things. So that euerie vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man ſets vp himſelfe, he doth nothing but ſeeke and ſerue himſelfe, and therefore is his owne Idoll, and an other god vnto himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This ſerues alſo to humble Gods children dayly with the conſideration of it: for who liues ſo holylie that doth not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſet vp an other god, that doth not ſometimes feare men more then God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that doth not often depend to much vppon outward matters, and hath to great a loue of earthly things. This ſhould humble vs then to think that wee are ſo much giuen to ſet vp vaine helps in our harts, as that none liues ſo cleere, but ſometimes he makes a falſe God vnto himſelfe. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that we may keep this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, we muſt learne to vſe all outward things as though we vſed them not, that ſo our mindes and affections and iudgements may be readie to ſerue God, and wee may alſo preſſe to doe his will. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſets himſelfe wholly to root and dig in the earth, and to ſeeke earthly matters, his hart will be ſo occupied &amp; foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with thoſe things, as that if he be called to any ſeruice of God, he muſt be faine to ſay I haue married a wife, I cannot come, my farme and myne Oxen will not let mee come: and all this while he ſets vp a ſtrange God. But then ſhall we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſincere, though not a perfect obedience to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, if we can come to vſe the world as though wee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:29174:22"/> it not, and neuer to truſt on theſe things when wee haue them (for the aboundance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot help vs, without gods bleſsing) and not to be diſcouraged and caſt downe, though they be all taken away: becauſe the want of them ſhall not hurt vs, if God be with vs, for we liue by his bleſsing, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt ſet our ſelues onely to reſt on him, and not to leane to any creature.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Before my face.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe this is the moſt ſpirituall commandement &amp; doth moſt preſſe vpon the hart, and we are moſt readie in this matter to diſſemble with men and with our owne harts, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſets a narrower ſcantling of it, &amp; ſaith before mee. Hence wee are taught, that it is not enough for vs to behaue our ſelues as that no impietie breake forth from vs into the face of men, but we muſt looke to our harts and ſee that none come in Gods ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a man may be preaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting others to the loue of God, yet if he doe this for his owne vaine glory, not for Gods glory, to get promotion to himſelfe and not ſaluation vnto Gods people, he at that very time ſets vp an Idoll in his hart, for God ſearcheth the hart, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith to <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſee that thou ſerue God with an vpright hart, or elſe for all thine outward obedience, thou ſhalt doe as good as nothing, for God hath a ſpecial regard of the hart, and doth as well ſee and diſcerne the moſt ſecret things of the ſoule, as any man doth the outward actions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. So <hi>Ieremie.</hi> 17. ver. 10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the hart,</hi> God doth not looke on the outſide onely, but on the inſide alſo, ſhewes cannot deceiue him.</p>
                  <p>If wee ſay and ſweare, and proteſt neuer ſo much, that wee loue him and feare him, and this be not in our ſoule, tis not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, but in his fight, there is nothing but hipocriſie &amp; diſsimulation. For men firſt muſt looke to the outward, and hence deſcend to iudge of the hart, but God firſt approueth the hart, and then the outward action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if wee ſee good things
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29174:22"/> outwardly, wee are bound in conſcience to think well of that man, but God will firſt ſee vprightneſſe, and then he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count well of the practiſes that we doe outwardly. This then confutes them, that think if they can carry themſelues that men cannot blame them, then all is well. But it is nothing, for God ſaith, waſh thine hart from iniquitie, O Ieruſalem, no waſhing of the outward, can doe any good, vnleſſe the hart be firſt well and throughly ſcoured.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs to carry our ſelues watchfully &amp; warily, and to feare as well ſecret as open ſinnes, becauſe all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets are open to God, and euery hidden thing is light before his face. This meditation helped <hi>Iob,</hi> that he would not allow ſo much as a wanton looke and by thought, for he knew that God beheld his wayes, and told all his ſteps, and he could not be deliuered from his highneſſe. If God had ſeene them onely and not taken any great heede or notice of them, it had not bene ſo much, but as he ſaw them, ſo he did keep them in a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, &amp; regard them, ſo as that according to theſe <hi>Iob</hi> ſhould receue his reward. In this regard he made a couenant with his eyes, and did walke in feare circumſpectly, and would ſuffer no vanitie or filthineſſe, once to enter into his hart. But the want of this perſwaſion that God lookes alwaies full vpon vs, &amp; his holy and pure eyes, that are like a flame of fire, are alwaies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt'ned vpon our waies and doings, is the cauſe that men haue ſo many couetous and craftie and cruell and filthie thoughts, and are come almoſt to that point of Atheiſme, that thought is free. But they ſhall finde that though it be free from men, yet it is not free from God, and that they ſhalbe lyable to the ſentence of condemnation, and culpable of euerlaſting death, before Gods Iudgement ſeat, vnleſſe they haue as great a care to haue holy and good thoughts, and to purge their hart in the ſight of God, as to haue honeſt and ciuill actions, and walke well before men. So much of the negatiue part of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. The affirmatiue followeth.</p>
                  <p>In this commandement we are commanded foure eſpeciall things. viz. To know God, to loue God, to feare him, and to
<pb facs="tcp:29174:23"/> truſt in him. Theſe things if we haue in our harts, then God beares the ſway there, and he is the commander of our ſoules and bodies. And firſt of knowledge. This commandement enjoynes euerie man to know God, according as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed himſelfe in his word, in eſſence, and his perſons, in his properties &amp; actions, &amp; according to this knowledge we muſt order our ſelues. As in Iohn 17, ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. <hi>This is</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>life eternall, to know thee and him whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> He that knowes God in Chriſt, hath the lyfe of grace in him, which is called life eternall, becauſe it hath the beginnings of life eternall, which ſhall neuer dye but encreaſe, till they come to the perfection of this lyfe. For if any one doe thus know God, how can he chuſe but loue him, and truſt in him, &amp; feare him, and doe euery thing that he commaunds. As Pſal. 9. <hi>Thoſe that know thee will truſt in thee.</hi> Some truſt in God, ſome doe not, what is the cauſe of this, Becauſe ſome know Gods power, and his trueth, and his juſtice, and ſufficiencie, and theſe will neuer truſt in any lawfull meanes, nor fall to any vnlawfull, but for others that doe not know him, they make no account of truſting in him. So <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith to <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. Chro. 26. <hi>My ſonne, know thou the God of thy fathers, and ſerue him with an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hart and a perfect minde.</hi> This is the foundation of true religion, and the ground-work of all vpright worſhip, to know God, when we know him, then we ſhall ſerue him: till wee know him there can be no ſeruing. But if wee know that he is ſuch a God as in whoſe eyes all things are naked, and that he ſearcheth and pryeth, into the harts and ſecret imaginations of the ſoule: this will make one take heed of diſſembling, and ſtriue to get an vpright hart, and ſo he will ſerue him with a willing minde, that doth know him; for why doe men ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſerue great perſonages, and are readie to employ them ſelues in their buſineſſes, but becauſe they think that hence they ſhall haue honour and credit, and come to credit as a rewarde of their ſeruices; but now if we know that God doth giue ſuch excellent wages as no man can giue the like, for what doth he not beſtow on thoſe that feare him? he giues them his ſonne,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29174:23"/> he giues them his holy Spirit and grace, in their harts: he giues them his feare and his bleſsing in this life, and life eternall in the world to come: if one know this, then he will ſure ſerue God with a willing minde. But on the contrary, the cauſe and fountaine of all rebellion and diſobedience againſt God is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no right knowledge of God, as he complaines in Hoſea. 2. <hi>That they lye, they ſteale, they commit adultery &amp; bloud toucheth bloud.</hi> But what was the cauſe of all this confuſion, why, becauſe there was no knowledge of God in the land, and where men know not God, what ſhould be looked for elſe, for then they cannot loue him, nor feare him, nor truſt in him, nor ſeeke, nor doe any dutie, if there be no knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues to confute all ignorant perſons that doe not know God, they cannot tell how many perſons there bee, or if they doe, they cannot tell what any of them did for them, they are not acquainted with the properties of God, nor with his actions, they neuer thought on his name, nor pondered on his trueth, his juſtice, his power, his mercie, and ſuch like things. Theſe may brag of loue and faith, and hope, and confidence, and patience, but they haue none of them, it cannot be, for all good things flow from this, that we doe know God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, 2. Theſſ. 1. 8. ver. <hi>That God will come with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Angells in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to all thoſe that know not him, nor obey not his gospel,</hi> theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cloſe, doth not one know God, then tis cleere he doth not obey his goſpel, he makes no conſcience of that; Therefore an ignorant hart is alwaies a ſinfull hart, &amp; a man without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a man without grace, and this ignorance is ſo foule a ſinne, as that it ſhalbe ſufficient to bring gods vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one, how euer light account men make of it, God will damne them for this, becauſe they haue not knowne, and then tis to to ſure they could not nor would haue regard to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. And on the other ſide, this muſt ſtirre vs vp to call for wiſdome, and to cry for vnderſtanding, to ſeeke for it, and to dig for it as for gold, or precious ſtones; We muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reade Gods word, &amp; confer of it, and meditate on it, which
<pb facs="tcp:29174:24"/> if we do it will giue vs vnderſtanding, &amp; then we ſhall ſee gods properties, and ſee his goodneſſe, &amp; his loue, and how able and willing hee is to help vs, and then we cannot chuſe but truſt in him. And indeede this often meditating and thinking on Gods word, is the next way to make vs like God, and to renue and repaire the image of God in vs. For by ſeeing Chriſt in the goſple, wee are chaunged from glory to glory, and the more wee know him, the more wee encreaſe in being like to him: ſo long as we know in part we are like in part, but when we ſhall haue perfect knowledge, then ſhall we be perfect in holineſſe, and perfect in righteouſneſſe, perfect and holy as he is perfect. As 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Now it appeareth not what we ſhall bee, but when he ſhall appeare wee ſhall bee like him,</hi> and why like him? becauſe we ſhall know him, as he is, ſo that the perfection of knowledge, will bring the perfection of holineſſe, &amp; the more we increaſe in knowledge, the more all good vertues will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and if this were perfect, we ſhould be perfect, without all weakeneſſe and infirmitie. But the more we meditate in Gods word, the more our knowledge will grow, and therefore alſo the image of God will grow more liuely, till we bee made perfect and abſolute in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>The next dutie is Loue. That wee muſt loue God withall our harts, and all our ſoules, as is commanded. <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. The reaſon is, becauſe he is that <hi>Iehouah</hi> in whom we liue, we moue, and haue our being, he is our God that giues vs all good things, and can onely free vs from all ſinne and miſerie, therefore wee are bound to loue him. And indeede, this is the chiefe dutie, and the beſt fruit of knowledge: but becauſe it is ſo plaine a dutie, as that no man will denie it, it is beſt for vs (leauing to vſe more words in prouing the dutie) to ſhew ſome markes of loue of God, (that we doe not deceiue our ſelues) whereby we may ſee, in what meaſure wee keepe this firſt and chiefe commandement. The firſt marke may be, how we delight to meet God in thoſe meanes, wherin he hath appointed to meet vs: for in what meaſure we can offer our ſelues to God in thoſe things, wherein hee offers himſelfe to vs, in that meaſure wee loue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29174:24"/> him. If we be willing to aſke all good things and ſeeke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at his hand by prayer, and to lay open our wants to him, and as it were to conferre with God. If we be deſirous to come to heare his word ſpoken vnto vs, wherein we may ſee his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for our direction, his mercie for our comfort, his povver for our defence, and for the ſubduing of our ſinnes, and his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to make vs rich, and ſupply all our wants, then we doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede loue God, and the more we can reioyce in theſe things, the more we loue God, and the leſſe, the leſſe we loue him. So for the ſacraments, in them Chriſt Ieſus offers himſelfe vnto vs, and to make vs partakers of his bodie and blould, would we then try how we loue God? vve may doe it by examining what deſire we haue to theſe things, would we rather come to this banquet of the heauenly King to eate the body and bloud of his ſonne, that is ſet before vs, rather then to the table of an earthly king, to taſt ſuch good cheere as hee can make vs, is there ſuch an affection to vs? then indeede we loue God, for then we haue a delight to come wher he is. For in theſe meanes God doth beſtow himſelfe vpon vs, and comes to dwel in vs, as Chriſt ſaith, that he will dwell in vs, and his father: the holy ghoſt will come into our harts.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond note whereby we may try our loue to God is, obedience, as Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Iohn. 14. 20. He that loues me keepes my commandements:</hi> He then that keepes Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſt, he loues God beſt. But if any will ſay that he loues God as well as the beſt, yet he will breake the ſaboth, and lye, and diſſemble, and be a miſer, wholy rooting on the earth, and ſetting himſelfe and all his hart after his couetouſneſſe, if no good ſpeach proceed out of his mouth, but onely froward and filthie, and vaine ſpeaches, if it be ſo, will wee ſay that we loue God? No, the loue of God breeds obedience vnto God. If one ſhould ſay that hee loued the King as well as any ſubject in England, yet he would alwaies be practiſing &amp; inuenting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rebellion againſt him, who could beleeue him? So, if we will ſpeake fooliſhly, and vainely breake Gods ſaboths, &amp; blaſpheme his name, and doe ſuch other wickedneſſes, doe we
<pb facs="tcp:29174:25"/> loue God? Nay, ſo far as any allowes himſelfe to doe theſe things, ſo far he hates God, as he that allowes himſelfe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, hatas the prince: ſo he that maintaines any ſinne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in himſelfe, he hates God. So that by theſe two things wee may examine our loue of God: firſt, in the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation what good affection we beare vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how we keepe Gods commandements. For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that hath my commandements &amp; keepes them, he loues mee.</hi> Frſt we muſt haue his commandements in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to know the meaning of them; and in our memory, that we may remember them; and then in our hart, to work on our affections; and laſtly in our practiſe we muſt keepe them, and in what degree we doe this thing, in that degree doe we loue God.</p>
                  <p>A third mark. That we obſerue and note our affection to Gods children. For this is a ſound note that we loue God, if we loue his children. As in <hi>Iohn. 5. He that loues him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, will loue him that is begotten.</hi> If then we finde in our harts a good affection vnto chriſtians, beecauſe they are chriſtians, how beneficiall or not beneficiall to vs, that is nothing; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they take notice of vs, or paſſe by vs, that is not the matter: but if they be ſuch that loue Gods word, and haue the vertues of Chriſt ſhining forth in their harts: if loue and patience, and temperance, &amp; meekeneſſe, &amp; ſuch like, doe appeare in them, if we loue theſe, this is an vndoubted teſtimonie of our true loue to God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth mark of our loue to God wherby we ſhall in deed make triall of our loue to him is, how we loue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. How we deſire the appearance of Chriſt to judge the quick and dead. And how we deſire to be diſſolued &amp; be with Chriſt. What deſire we haue either to goe vnto him, or to haue him come to vs. For if our hart be ſet truly vpon any thing, that thing we cannot chuſe but deſire, and be willing to haue it with vs. Loue drawes the minde to that which is loued. So <hi>Paull</hi> when the loue of God waxed warme in his hart, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt. So in the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29174:25"/> the ſpirit, and the Church, and the bride, and all ſay, <hi>Come Lord, come quickly:</hi> and in the naturall marriage, in which the loue is much more weake and ſlender, yet this is manifeſt, for if the wife loue her husband, when hee is gone farre off ſhe will be deſirous of his returne, and will bee glad to haue his company: if this be ſo in the naturall marriage, where there be many infirmities and croſſes, yet they doe wiſh for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany one of another, how much more in the ſpirituall marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, where there is ſuch perfection now in the one partie, as he is full of loue and mercy, and alſo ſhall free the other partie from all miſeries and wants, and infirmities, when they ſhall be joyned fully together, and fill them full of all vertues and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in this marriage I ſay, how can one chooſe but long after this perfect and happie meeting, how can he ſtay himſelfe that hath any loue &amp; aſſurance of theſe things, but hee ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to flie vp into heauen, &amp; the flame of his deſire will burne aboue the cloudes, to wiſh that God would come and dwell with vs. If the wife ſhould ſay, I loue mine husband as well as any woman in the world, O but how ſay you, your husband hath beene from you a long time, but at ſuch a time hee will returne. O I pray you ſpeake not of that, you will make mee ſicke if you talke of it, indeede I loue him, but I care not how far of from me he be, who would not perceiue that this were meere deſſembling &amp; no true loue indeed, can a woman loue her husband, and not deſire his companie? So if we will beare others in hand, that we loue God aboue all, and no man loues God better then wee, yet we neuer deſire to come at him, or to haue him come at vs: what a loue is this? a very weake loue it is ſure or none. We muſt pray therefore and endeauour that we may long for, and wiſh for the comming of Chriſt, for God hath giuen this to other of his children, that were as weake as wee, that when they did thinke of their good eſtate, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all miſerie and ſinne, and that the loue of God was ſhed abroad in their harts, this did ſo inflame their harts, as they deſired his comming, by which they ſhould be deliuered from all ſinne and miſerie, more then any woman could deſire the
<pb facs="tcp:29174:26"/> comming of her husband.</p>
                  <p>The fift and laſt note, wherby we ſhall finde out in trueth, how wee loue God, is to conſider how wee ſtand affected to that which he hates. One indeed may loue a man truely, and yet not hate all that he hates, becauſe his hatred may be vnjuſt, or elſe he may exceede in the meaſure of hatred. But for God, we know that he is perfect, &amp; hates nothing but that which is hatefull, &amp; abhorres none but thoſe which deſerue to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Therfore try and ſee how we ſtand affected to the wolrd. God ſaith that hee hates the worlde, by the world is ment, as Saint Iohn expoundes it; the luſt of the eies; the luſt of the hart; and the pride of life; we muſt hate theſe thinges, for the loue of the world is enmitie to God. He that loues it then, is an enemie; for hee that loues Gods enemies, makes himſelfe an enemie: as he that hates that which God loues, hates God, ſo hee that loues that which God hates, hates God alſo. Alſo we muſt ſee how we hate couetouſneſſe, mallice, pride, filthineſſe, falſhoode, and ſuch like, for all theſe things God hates. But if one be ſo far from abhorring lying, as that he himſelf will lie; &amp; ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hating flatterie, as he himſelfe will flatter; &amp; ſpeake faire before ones face, but ill inough behind his backe, if one be ſo far from hating vnthriftineſſe, as that he will be a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter &amp; ſpend thoſe things idly and fooliſhly, which God gaue him for a better end, and will take an account of him alſo, how he ſpent them, becauſe God beſtowed them for better ends, and he beſtowes them proudly, vainely, and vnthriftely, to no glory to God, or good to men; he that will doe theſe or any ſuch thinges, it is plaine that hee hates not that which God hates, and therefore doth not loue God.</p>
                  <p>By theſe things then, wee may examine our ſelues, and finde whether we haue any true loue to god or not: namely by his loue, to the meanes of ſaluation, and by his keeping Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, by his ſeruent and harty loue to Gods people, in wiſhing and alſo doing then good to his power, by his deſire to bee joyned to Chriſt Ieſus, and laſtly by his hatred of thoſe things which God hateth, which though they doe often ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29174:26"/> him, yet he loues himſelfe the leſſe, becauſe hee can hate them no more, and thinkes the worſe of himſelfe, becauſe hee loues them at all.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things who ſo can finde in himſelfe, hee loues God and obeyes this commandement, though not in perfection (for no man can in his nature, and indeede it is not needefull that any of vs ſhould, for Chriſt did it for vs) yet in vprightneſſe and in ſome good meaſure, and he ſerues God with that which hee accounts a perfect hart.</p>
                  <p>So much of the loue of God, a fruit of knowledge, when knowing his goodnes, his mercie, his truth, &amp; other his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we giue him all our ſoule, ſetting our affections on nothing in earth beſides him, delighting in him alone, and in nothing but that which carries a ſtampe of his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The next dutie that is heere commanded, is the feare of God, a dutie proceeding from knowledge alſo: for as the ſight of Gods goodneſſe, and mercy, and truth, will inflame the hart with a loue of him: So if one behold and conſider his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and his power, and his excellencie, ouer all his creatures, this will ſtrike his hart with a wonderfull reuerence, &amp; a great feare of his Majeſtie. As alſo hee that knowes Gods power that he can doe what hee will, and his mercy that hee will doe what is needefull for the good of his children, this will make him truſt wholy in God. But for this feare, an objection muſt firſt be anſwered. For 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. he ſaith, <hi>Perfect loue caſteth out feare.</hi> And <hi>Luke. 1. We are deliuered from all our enemies, that we might ſerue him without feare.</hi> To this wee anſwere, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue caſteth out feare; namely a ſlauiſh feare, and ſuch as is in the diuels, who tremble before God, but ſo as they runne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſuch as is in wicked men when the threatnings of God arreſts their euill conſcience, and ſummons their wicked harts, and drawes them before Gods iudgement ſeat, &amp; makes them therefore not loue Gods word and miniſtry, but hate it, &amp; caſt off all care of Godlineſſe, and religion from them. But it is true that whoſoeuer loues God, cannot chuſe but in the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alſo feare him: for the ſpirit of God that perſwades them
<pb facs="tcp:29174:27"/> of his fauour and worketh loue, will declare his power and greatneſſe, which will worke a feare and awe of him. It caſteth out the helliſh feare that makes one flie from God, but it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that holie feare, that makes one more careful to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and to worſhip him. Wee muſt then loue God with our whole harts, and ſoules, and mindes, ſo that wee feare nothing but in him and for him, and that with ſuch a feare, as muſt draw vs vnto him, but terrifieng our harts from committing all euill. It muſt be a feare mingled with loue and confidence, that muſt be holy, and crucifie, and reſtraine all ill affections and deſires. This is commanded. <hi>Iſai. 8. 13. Sanctifie the Lord in your harts, and let him be your feare and your dread.</hi> The occaſion of this precept was this. Before in the chap he ſhewes that there were ſtirres and rumours of warres, in the land, the people and King and all did quake as leaues ſhaken with wind by reaſon of the great feare which was in them. Now then heere hee brings a medicine that will make them ſtill and quiet: for the cauſe of their falſe feares was, becauſe they were emptie of true feare, and they were ſo exceedingly troubled with men, becauſe they could not looke vp vnto God. But in the 12. ver. the Prophet faith, <hi>You that bee Gods children, doe not you feare their feare.</hi> Feare not you the feares of wicked men, for they feare nothing but pouertie, and outward diſgrace, and a temporall death, all weather and hard caſualties to themſelues &amp; their goods, theſe bee baſe feares, and not worthie that the harts of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be taken vp with them being but trifles, feare not theſe things then, nor feare them (that is) not wicked men, feare neither the feares which wicked men feare, nor feare not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men themſelues. But now becauſe the hart of man muſt feare ſomething, and leaſt it be very well armed, it is ready to feare man, and the feares of man, therefore he ſhewes a meanes how to keepe one from all infection of ſuch fooliſh feares, and that is, to ſanctifie God in our hart, and to let him be our dread. Sanctifie god in our hart j. giue him the praiſe of his power, of his mercie, of his trueth, &amp; of all his attributs; &amp; then he ſhalbe our dread. For he that giues god the praiſe of his power, wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29174:27"/> ſtand in feare of a man; for he knowes the power of god is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of man. He that giues him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of his mercie, will not be diſmaid, though he ſee all wants, &amp; an hard eſtate outwardly, for he knows that gods mercie wil ſupply all, &amp; he that giues him the praiſe of his trueth, wil not be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for any danger, becauſe god hath promiſed to ſtuſtain him in all, and to deliuer him out of all. This is then to feare God with all our harts, to feare him onely, and neither to feare wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, nor the things which they feare, for ſo far as we doe feare either of theſe, we breake his commandement, and our harts are voide of the true feare of God. So <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 4. 5. Chriſt Ieſus ſaith, <hi>Feare not them that kill the bodie, and after that are not able to doe any more, But I will forewarne you whom you ſhall feare, feare him that after he hath killed, can caſt into hell, I ſay vnto you, him feare.</hi> Where he ſaith, that can kill the bodie, tis not to be vnderſtoode as though any man had any power in himſelfe to kill it, but God giues them leaue ſome-times, and by his permiſsion, for the humbling of his children, they are able to kill them; as if he had ſaid: This is the nature of men, that if they ſee any grow powerfull &amp; great, they are afrayd &amp; think how ſhall we eſcape, how can any be free from daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, now ſuch perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be ſet vp: but why ſhould you be ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at their promotion, or why ſhould you be afrayd, when they haue done their worſt, what can they doe, the moſt is to trouble you a little, and to ſend you from this houſe of clay, to heauen: they can go no further then to the killing of your bodie. But if you will feare profitably, and ſo as you ſhalbe the better for your fearing, I tell you who you ſhall feare, &amp; I repeat it againe, that you may the better mark it, <hi>I ſay, feare him that when he hath killed the bodie, can kill the ſoule to,</hi> and if you feare him you neede not feare men, for this true feare will caſt out all falſe feare. Likewiſe <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13. The holy ghoſt ſaith, <hi>That this is the end of all, to feare God and keepe his commandements.</hi> And Prouerbes. 1. <hi>The feare of God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſdome.</hi> Would we haue the beginning of wiſdom then, and the end of all, then let vs feare God, giue him the
<pb facs="tcp:29174:28"/> honour of his greatneſſe, and tremble alwaies before his face. There are diuers reaſons alſo to moue vs with all our ſtrength &amp; endeuour, to get this feare of God in our harts. Draw from the benefits which will flow from it, to euery one that doth in trueth embrace it. Firſt that may be a good reaſon to perſwade vs, which is ſaid. Prouerbs. 8. 13. <hi>The feare of the Lord is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie.</hi> Wher he ſhewes that in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure any one feareth God, in the ſame meaſure he will loath, &amp; deteſt all euill: yea, not onely the open and hatefull ſinnes that the world will condemne, but the moſt ſecret and bidden. For he ſaith not to hate euill, as murdure, and adultery, but pride, &amp; arrogancie, thoſe which lye in the hart, and doe not ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the world, yet he that feareth God, will hate thoſe. This is one excellent priuiledge that he hath that feareth god, that he will not offend God, and therefore hateth what euer might offend. So that he is well fenced againſt all ſecret wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. As we may ſee in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> though he might haue done that euill to which he was ſolicited moſt ſecretly, that no man could haue ſpied or perceaued it, yet he would not for all the world conſent: and the reaſon was, the feare of God made him hate it in his hart, and hating it inwardly, he would neuer prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it outwardly. So <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, <hi>That he could haue borne out his oppreſſion, and could haue made all ſtoope to him, no man would haue gone about to finde fault with him,</hi> yet he durſt not for all that, his hart would not let him, for gods Iudgement was terrible in his eyes, and he could not be deliuered from his highneſſe, and this was that, that kept him from doing wrong, though no man durſt haue gone about to haue ſought reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the feare of God if it once throughly doe poſſeſſe the hart, will make one plyable and frameable to Gods will, though it be neuer ſo contrary to his nature, and former beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. As the example of <hi>Paul</hi> will ſhew: for when God comes to him and ſinites him downe off his horſe, and fills his heart full of horrible feares and terrors, and ſtrikes him downe to the ground with them, and let him perceiue a litle the majeſtie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29174:28"/> and power of God, and then after begins to reaſon the matter with him, and ſhewes him that he is a perſecutor of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, then he is preſently quiet and ſayth, Lord what ſhall I doe? That which all the preaching in the world could not doe, nor all the miracles that he had ſeene and hard, that did this feare of God worke in a ſhort time, and did ſo effectualy call him in that little ſpace, as that hee neuer turned backe againe. One might haue thought; what would men ſay, if I ſhould turne from perſecuting to preaching, &amp; of the ſudden all at once goe to be an Apoſtle, that was a perſecutor? what will the high Prieſtes ſay, from whom I haue letters, they will ſay I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, &amp; that I doe them iniurie, and Paul might ſeeme to haue many reaſons to keepe him from preaching Chriſt ſo, all vppon the ſudden, but all is nothing now, no, no, the true feare of God caſts of all obiections, for it ſo ſurpriſeth the luſts of the fleſh, and makes the ſtrenght of ſinne ſo much to abate, as that one cares for nothing, nor regardes nothing in all the world, ſo that God may be pleaſed, and he eſcape the anger of God.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. God did ſend him about ſuch a peece of worke, as he knew would be full tedious vnto him, and goe againſt his ſtomacke, namely that hee muſt preach to harden the hartes of the people, and be a miniſter of death vnto his hearers, which was as bitter as death to him, and he could neuer haue yelded to it. But now God comes not with the bare precept, for that would haue done litle good, the thing was ſo contrarie to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he would neuer haue obeyed, but he ſhewes him ſelfe to him in a viſion and lets him ſee his mageſtie in ſuch a fearfull ſort, as that he fals flat on the duſt for feare, and his body quakes and he cries out, what ſhall I doe? I am a man of polluted lips and dwell among people of polluted lips. I ſhall ſurely die, for I haue ſeene the Lord. When he was thus throughly affrighted and the pride of his fleſh was beaten downe, with the apprehenſion of Gods infinitie, then when God aſkes who will goe, he is ready and ſayeth, Lord ſend me, and ſo God ſends him, and he goes immediatly and willingly,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:29"/> there is no diſputing now, nor reaſoning the matter, for all the obiections that men make, and all their diſputing, that they thinke Gods commaundements bee hard and greiuous, and why ſhould they denie them ſelues? why ſhould not they haue their pleaſure? Hence it comes, that they feare not God, they doe not thinke of his greatneſſe, nor conſider his wonderfull might and ſtrength, for if they could bring their hart once to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his exceeding greatnes, their hart would ſoone ſtoope, all arguments would fall to the ground, &amp; all would be quiet ſtraight. For this will tame the fierceneſſe and boyſtrouſneſſe that is in mens harts, and make them gentle and ſtill inough. As we ſee in <hi>Iob,</hi> though he was a verie good and patient man, yet when his fleſh began a litle to worke, and his hart was diſquieted and vexed by the wordes of his friendes, then he would needs bee dealing with God, hee thought hee had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſpeake, &amp; imagined that he could ſay much for himſelf, he would fill his mouth with argumentes, and faine he would haue God to come to heare what hee could ſpeake, in his owne defence, and to ſhew what wrong was done to him. But now when God comes, and there ſhewes him the nature of the ſnow, and the ice, and of ſome other creatures of god, as it were to let him ſee how childiſh he was in theſe ſeuerall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and fooliſh and ignorant of the creation or preſeruation of theſe leaſt thinges, that he had no knowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was a trimme man to call God to account, and that God muſt come to giue his anſwere before him, that he ſhould ſit in the ſeate of Iudgement &amp; on the bench, and God ſtand at the barre, hee was like to diſpute well with God his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that did not know the nature of the leaſt of his creatures. When God had argued with him thus a while, and hee ſaw how great God was, and how exellent: <hi>Iob</hi> was done, hee had no more to ſay, but now indeede hee confeſſeth hee had ſpoken fooliſhly, but hee would doe ſo no more, hee would now bee ſtill and content to beare Gods hand, let him doe what hee would, if hee would kill him hee was content to die, but hee would neuer diſpute with God any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29174:29"/> more. So we ſee how quiet <hi>Iob</hi> was now, and what good and notable effectes this feare of God will worke in the harts of men, if it once ſoundly and throughly poſſeſſe them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, God hath promiſed that hee that feareth him, ſhall want no good thing, hee may want oftentimes that which his wicked fleſh would haue, for in deede and truth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more hurtfull and peſtilent to a man, then that which his fleſh doth moſt eagerly purſue and hunt after, and with greateſt vehemencie deſire: and on the contrary, nothing is more truely profitable and good for the ſoule, then that the fleſh and deſires of it ſhould be maſtred &amp; cruſhed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, therefore it is true that hee which feares God moſt, ſhall moſt want thoſe things which his fleſh deſires, becauſe they would doe him hurt, but God will with-hold no good thing from him, that which indeede is good, and the word and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſhewes to bee good, and will by effect ſhew it ſelfe to bee good, that hee ſhall neuer want. Alſo in the 112. Pſa. he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth God.</hi> This alwaies brings Gods bleſsing with it, whereuer it comes: ſo that would we bee helped againſt our ſinne, and haue the pride of our fleſh crucified, and be helped to obedience? would we be rid of all euill things, and want no good thing? the very pathway that leades to theſe, is the feare of God, which is accompanied with the bleſsing of God, that is, the treaſure of all good things.</p>
                  <p>The vſe that we muſt make of this is, that ſo far as we would haue all our wants ſupplied, &amp; haue the bleſsing of God vpon our ſoule &amp; body, &amp; haue aboundance of all good things for this life, and the life to come, then we muſt labour to bring our harts to the true &amp; right feare of God, that we may tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his greatnes, &amp; to reuerence &amp; dread the great name of the Lord of hoaſts. The way to attaine this is, firſt, to deny our ſelues quite, to renounce vtterly our carnall wiſdom, as he ſaith, <hi>Pro. 3. 7. Be not wiſe in thine owne eies, but feare God, and depart from euill.</hi> If one will be reaſoning the matter according to the fleſhly wiſedome of men, and hee hath reaſon to doe that
<pb facs="tcp:29174:30"/> he doth, then ſurely he will neuer haue reaſon to be religious and ſerue God, for that is againſt his reaſon, for <hi>Salomon</hi> would haue vs feare God, &amp; how ſhall one come to doe that, he muſt not be conceated of his owne wiſdome, he muſt not think wel of carnall reaſon, nor be ruled by it, for the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmitie to God in all things: yea, the carnall wiſdome of a ſpirituall man is enmitie to God, and goodneſſe, &amp; ſo long as one followes it, he ſhall neuer feare God. As we may ſee this in <hi>Euah,</hi> when ſhe would goe to conſult with that carnall reaſon that the diuell had put into her head, &amp; began to think with her ſelfe, ſurely this fruit is faire to looke to, it hath a good coulour to the eye, and it is like the taſt will be pleaſant to the mouth, and then I ſhall get well by it, for I ſhall get much knowledge, and bee made like God, ſo that my ſtate ſhall bee mended, for this the Diuell had perſwaded her off: then ſhee fals to eate the forbidden fruit, and to tempt her husband; and to doe any thing that the Diuell would tempt her vnto, and feares God no more then if ſhe had bene ſure there had bene no God. Wee muſt forgoe our fleſhly wiſdome, and forſake our carnall reaſon then, if euer wee will feare God, and not conſult with fleſh and bloud, for if we doe, that will draw vs farre inough from God, and make vs neuer regard him. The ſecond thing that we muſt doe, to obtaine true feare of God, is to aske it of him; to confeſſe that in our ſelues, we haue no true feare of God; but are altogether prophane: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes of vnregenerate men, that they haue not the feare of God before their eies, but thinke that there is no God; and liue as if there were no God; wee muſt then confeſſe and ſee our owne wants, and intreate God to ſupply the ſame, to put his feare in our harts, eſpecially ſince hee hath promiſed this to all his elect; and in his couenant hath ſaid, that he will put his feare in their harts that they may feare him. And he hath beſtowed it alſo vpon others of his children; as on <hi>Dauid,</hi> for hee ſaith that he did feare and tremble before the iudgements of God: and if we aske it God according to his owne couenant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his former dealing with other of his children, will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29174:30"/> beſtow it vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>The laſt meanes to obtaine this holy feare of God, is often to thinke and meditate vpon Gods fearefull iudgements, which he hath executed vpon ſinners, for this will breed in our harts a ſence &amp; awe of his Mageſtie: as to thinke that God did not ſpare the Angels, being more excellent creatures, and farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vs in glory and ſtrength, but when they forſooke their place that their creator had ſet them in, &amp; rebelled againſt him, he caſt them into hell, into extreame &amp; miſerable torments; &amp; keepes them faſt linked and tied in chaines of darkneſſe, for a wonderfull great addition of paine, for all their ſinnes at the laſt day. So vpon the olde world, when they forſooke God, and the law of God, and grew to be earthly minded, and to ſet their harts altogether on the world, not regarding God nor religion. In this generall apoſtacie and departing from God, hee ſent a generall floud, which did ouerwhelme and drowne them all, ſo that they could not eſcape his hand of juſtice. So on Sodom and Gomorah, when they grew filthie &amp; prophane, and were full of idleneſſe, and abuſing the good benefites of God, he rayned fire &amp; brimſtone from heauen vpon them, and deuoured them all. And in all times, what cittie, or perticuler perſon, or countrie did grow ſinfull &amp; ſtubborne againſt him, hee grew terrible and ſhewed himſelfe terrible, by his feareful vengeance and plagues vpon them. Thus the often meditation and dilligent pondering on Gods threatnings and curſes, and the moſt certaine &amp; fearefull execution of them vpon impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons, will ſoften our harts, &amp; draw them more &amp; more to ſtand in feare of this great God. And if we will thus deny our ſelues, and our fleſhly reaſon, and pray vnto God for his feare, and labour to kindle his feare in our harts, by calling to remembrance his fearefulneſſe, and juſt, and terrible vengeance vpon thoſe that haue not feared him: this will at lenght bring our prophane harts, to ſome dread and reuerence of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mageſtie.</p>
                  <p>The next vſe that we may make, is for the comfort of thoſe of Gods children, that can in ſome meaſure bring their fleſh
<pb facs="tcp:29174:31"/> to feare and tremble before God, and to ſtand in awe of him, this will certainely bring all happineſſe vnto them, and thoſe that can doe ſo, they may be aſſured that whatſoeuer affliction they be in, it ſhall either be remoued, or be ſo ſanctified and bleſſed vnto them, as they ſhall beare it with much comfort &amp; profit. As Pſ. 112. ver. 2. <hi>His ſeede ſhalbe mightie vpon the earth.</hi> Seede mightie, will we think? how can that be, what haue they to make them mightie? what hath he to leaue them? how can they be mightie, when he hath nothing to beſtow on them: yes he hath enough, for ſo he ads, his children ſhalbe bleſſed. It is not lands and liuings, &amp; great poſſeſsions that make ones chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren great, for one may haue them and yet he hath no promiſe, but that himſelfe and his children ſhall haue the curſe of God vpon them while they liue, and be caſt into hell fire and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation when they dye. But it is the feare of God that makes a man happie himſelfe, and that will leaue a good and happie ſtate vnto his children after, for this brings the bleſsing of God vpon himſelfe, and vpon his ſeed after him, that they ſhall continue happie ſo long as they continue fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God. But that we may not deceiue our ſelues and think either that wee haue not the feare of God at all, becauſe wee haue it not perfectly, though we haue it in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or elſe think that we haue it when indeed we haue it not: It is good that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider ſome marks whereby we may know whether we haue indeed this feare of God or no.</p>
                  <p>One true note of the feare of God is, to feare the word of God, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heare the word of God yee that tremble before him.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I would that all myne hearers would profit by the word of God, which I ſpeake vnto them; but I know that none will make vſe of it but onely thoſe that feare him; as alſo the prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſayd. <hi>That when hee heard Gods threatnings, he feared, and his belly trembled, and rottenneſſe entred into his bones, and he was wonderfully diſmaide and terrified.</hi> If then the threatnings of gods word can affright vs, and make vs tremble, and afrayde, to doe thoſe things which he hath forbidden, or if we haue ſinne, they make vs confeſſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29174:31"/> our ſinnes, &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble our ſoules before God for mercie: this is an vndoubted token of the feare of God. But if one will ſay that he feares God &amp; reuerenceth the mageſtie of God but for his word let God threaten as much as he will he cares not for it; let the Miniſter denounce gods Iudgements and curſes vpon him, and againſt him, he is a ſleepe, and it doth not awake nor prick him, he neither hath any touch nor feeling of it, but lets it paſſe without any regard; it is moſt ſure that ſuch an one for all his ſayings hath no feare of God in his hart. According as God complaines, by the prophet <hi>Amos, That if the Lion did roare, all the beaſts of the field would tremble:</hi> but they were more beaſtly then beaſts, &amp; ſo ſenceleſſe, that let god roare &amp; roare againe as loud as he would, yet they cared not, nor were not a whit afrayd; ſo that the verie beaſts gaue more reuerence to the Lion then they did vnto God. If we heare the threatnings of God denounced powerfully againſt couetous &amp; deceitful &amp; cruel perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; againſt ſuch as break gods ſaboths, againſt earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly minded men, that ſet themſelues wholy to root in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; to ſeeke for fleſhly things; If we heare theſe threatnings, &amp; beleued that they were true, when we finde them in our ſelues, how could we chooſe but feare &amp; tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble. But herein moſt men bewray their monſtrous &amp; ſhameful hipocriſie, that if a great man, ſome king, or prince, did but threaten that they ſhould be put in priſon, &amp; lye in priſon all their life, or that they ſhould be put to death, they would ſhake euery joynt, &amp; ſhew their feare in their face, that no man could make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> merry, in ſuch a caſe, but they would lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; take on vnmeſurably. But let god threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten &amp; proteſt that he wil curſe them &amp; damne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; caſt them into hel for euer, it neuer feares the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they can go about as merely &amp; cherfully as though ther were no danger: yea, they will make oft times a mock, &amp; a ſcoffe at thoſe judgments. What a moſt plain &amp; palpable diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling is this, that men wil prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to feare god aboue all, &amp; yet will be much more afraid if a man do but threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to turne them out of their houſe, then if god threaten to turne them out of heauen to be in hell for euer: that one angry word of their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlord wil feare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty threatnings out of
<pb facs="tcp:29174:32"/> the ſcripture of God, will not moue them one whit, nor work the leaſt ſorrow in them. By trying our affections to the word of God then, we may ſee our affections to God himſelfe; either in loue, for he that loues Gods word moſt, may aſſure his ſoule that hee loues God beſt: or in feare, for hee that moſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and is moſt humble at Gods threatnings, hee carries the greateſt reuerence towards God himſelfe, and ſo that he that puts greateſt confidence in the promiſes of God, doth moſt faithfully truſt in God.</p>
                  <p>Another ſure badge of this true feare is, that it will make one depart from euill, it will not make him onely confeſſe &amp; ſay, indeede it is naught, and it is my fault and my nature, and I would I could leaue it, but it will worke a ſeperation bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſinne and the ſoule, ſo that it will depart from euill, what danger ſo euer ſeeme to enſue vpon it, and he will not be alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any reward to commit ſinne. In what meaſure the feare of God hath ſeaſoned the hart, in the ſame meaſure it will worke this departing from ſinne: as we ſee it plainely proued by the example of the three children. The caſe ſtoode thus with them, that either they muſt bow to the filthie idoll which was before them, or burne in that flaming fornace, which was prepared for him that would not; either they muſt purchaſe and procure the wrath of God, or ſuffer the wrath &amp; diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Nabuchadnezer,</hi> but hauing the feare of God within them, it gaue them courage and boldneſſe, that they feared not <hi>Nabuchadnezers</hi> threatning and power, but ſtoode reſolute for the cauſe of God, and ſhewed the King plainely that they would not diſhonor God, to pleaſe him, or for his anger; if god would they knew that he could deliuer them, if he would not yet this they let him know, that they would not incurre Gods anger, and danger of euerlaſting death, for feare of any bodily death. But on the contrary ſide, ſo farre as any man hath not the feare of God, but feares man more then God, then they will vpon euery occaſion runne to euill, as if one be in ſome fault, that he thinkes he ſhall be puniſhed for it, then he will help himſelfe by lying, and thinkes that he hath made a very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29174:32"/> good ſhift, if he can eſcape by that meanes, this is now to make man a god, and god an Idoll, when one will ſeeke to make the face of man milde and gentle, by making gods face angry &amp; frowning. So thoſe that when they be in diſtreſſe and in ſome neede by pouertie, will venture to help themſelues by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gods ſaboth, &amp; taking time from his worſhip to labour for their owne gaine: this is plaine, that they feare the feare of the wicked, and doe not make God their dread, for if they did, it is moſt ſure, they would depart from euill. So he that feareth god, no hope of promotion or outward benefit can make him conſent to wickedneſſe; as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> might in likelihood haue ben a great gainer, and gotten much promotion, by yelding to the wicked and filthie allurements of his miſtreſſe: yet he would not giue the leaſt mark of conſenting, becauſe he was afrayde to ſinne againſt god. So in <hi>Iſa. 51. 12. Who art thou that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt mortall man, that muſt be giuen to the wormes, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy God that did ſpread out the heauens.</hi> The great feare of mans power ariſeth from the forgetting of gods free power. When one is in ſuch a terrour of man that is but duſt, and cannot defend himſelfe againſt the wormes, but they ſhall creepe in his bowells and eate vp his hart, will he nill he, it comes from hence that one doth quite forget that there is ſuch a God as was able to make heauen and earth of nothing, and that hath fearefull judgements layde vp for ſinners, and then indeed he feares man, and then he will ſinne if he bid him, and rather be ſo ſeruile to his maſter and ſuperiour, as to breake Gods law, then to beare his anger and chiding or correction, and if man bid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him doe any thing, he will doe it, though God bid him doe the contrarie. Therefore in the Reuel. when he reckons vp a great rable of reprobates, and the whole hoſt of damned ſinners, he puts the fearefull in the verie forefront of them, and makes them the captaines &amp; ring-leaders of all the reſt, thoſe which be fearefull &amp; not fearefull; that be not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſpleaſe God &amp; breake his law, but herein they be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and impudent, but for any good ſeruice of God, they be afrayde to doe it. They be afraid to keepe the ſaboth, or
<pb facs="tcp:29174:33"/> goe to heare ſermons, leaſt they ſhould be accounted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: they will not ſerue God, leaſt their old acquaintance and friends ſhould forſake them, &amp; leaſt their neighbours ſhould mock &amp; laugh at them; they feare leaſt they ſhould be jeſted at. This daſtardlineſſe and coldneſſe to doe good, but courage and readineſſe to doe ill, that if men doe but hold vp the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the baſeſt and moſt abject perſons in a country, doe but ſpeake a word or two, he may allure and perſwade them to drink &amp; ſwill, and breake the ſabbath, and ſuch other filthie ſinnes which they haue promiſed to forſake, and God hath threatned to puniſh; ſhewes plainely, that they be voide of the true feare of God.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt note of the true feare of God is, to delight in Gods commandements, to walke in his wayes, as he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth God, and delighteth greatly in his commandements.</hi> He that hath no delight to walk in gods waies, but in his owne, &amp; hath all the pleaſure in talking of his owne commoditie and profit, not of Gods lawes: as though himſelfe were the god to be ſerued, and luſt had the ſouerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and command of his hart and not God; ſuch an one hath not the feare of God, but if one delight to conferre of gods law, and take his greateſt pleaſure in ſpeaking and thinking of Gods commandements, ſuch an one may conclude with him ſelfe aſſuredly, that he hath that feare of God in his hart, which will keepe him to euerlaſting life, ſo long as hee keepes and embraceth it.</p>
                  <p>Hence then the beſt man in this world may learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his owne weakneſſe, and to acknowledge the wants and defects of this feare of God; for that ſo much feare of death and of pouertie, and of diſgrace, and of men, ſhewes a great emptineſſe of the feare of God. This trembling at mens thrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſo much, &amp; at gods threatnings ſo little, that is in all men by nature, the great feare of looſing earthly things, and little feare to looſe heauenly things, the much delight we haue in matters of this world, and little delight in the law of God, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies to our faces, &amp; ſhewes plainely that we haue but a verie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29174:33"/> little ſparke of the true feare of God, thoſe which haue moſt of it. Theſe wants we muſt ſee and confeſſe, and runne vnto Chriſt Ieſus that made a perfect and abſolute ſatisfaction, that he might ſupply our imperfections, and then of his fulneſſe we ſhall haue enough to fulfill that wherin our ſelues came ſhort.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the true &amp; holy feare that God commands, ſuch a feare as being joyned with loue and proceding from it, makes vs loue him more, and more obey him.</p>
                  <p>The next and laſt dutie commanded in this firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, is to truſt in God with all our harts, to put our full confidence, and relie wholy vpon him, and him alone.</p>
                  <p>This is commanded. <hi>Prou. 3. 5. Truſt on God, with all thine heart, and leane not to thine owne wiſedome.</hi> Though thine owne reaſon tell thee, now that I haue great proſperity, and the vvorld at will, I ſhall bee ſafe, yet truſt not to that, but make God thine onely ſtay. So <hi>Iere. 17. 7. Bleſſed is that man that truſts in God, and makes him his ſtay, for hee ſhall be like the tree planted by the water ſide.</hi> Hee ſhewes that hee that truſts in God, ſhall be bleſſed of God, ſo that he ſhall be ſtill in a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhng eſtate, vvhat euer heat, j. ſtirres or alterations and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges others feele, hee ſhall bee well ſtill, for he ſhall be alwaies fruitfull, and indeede this is the onely happineſſe of a chriſtian to bee fruitfull in good workes, and this is the miſerie of all miſeries, to be barren in good workes, that pincheth his hart, &amp; is as a ſcorching heat indeed, but ſo long as one truſts in God, he ſhal be kept in the ſpring ſtill, it ſhal be no winter nor fal of the leafe; Faith makes a perpetuall ſpring time. So he ſaith in the Pſa. <hi>Truſt in God, and hee ſhall giue thee thine harts deſire,</hi> hee that would haue what he can wiſh or deſire, let him truſt in god, for this intitles him to all gods promiſes, yea it giues him intreſt to god himſelfe, and hauing him, he can want nothing. The meanes how we ſhall come to this truſt in god, is to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on his power, to know that he is able to help vs, though we haue all the vvorld againſt vs, and contrariwiſe that vnleſſe God doe help vs, all the world, and all the helps in the world, ſhall bee no furtherance vnto vs. Then alſo to conſider his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:34"/> mercy, that hath deliuered other of his children, when they vvere in as great neceſsitie, and vvhen they vvere drunken with gall and vvormewood with ſore and grieuous afflictions, hee hath made them ſober vvith true comfort and conſolation. Theſe meditations often ariſing and nouriſhed in our harts, will bring vs at length to leane to him, and build onely vpon him, that is the ſure and vnremoueable foundation.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this is, to teach vs to get this confidence and truſt in God, that ſo vvee may haue our harts deſire, and may alwaies flouriſh, that though heat come, though temptations and calamities befall vs, and all things ſeemed to be tumbled and caſt vpſide downe, yet wee bee in ſafetie, for no man is hurt till vnbeleefe and diſtruſt hurt him, if the ſoule bee not hurt by vnbeleefe, all other things are ſo farre from hurting vs, as that they ſhall do vs great good. Now the markes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may know that wee doe in deede, not in word onely, truſt and relie vpon God alone, are (that we may name ſome of them) theſe: firſt to vſe all good meanes faithfully to ſerue Gods prouidence, no man is more diligent in putting all good meanes in practiſe, then he that hath a moſt conſtant &amp; firme faith in God. As we may ſee that in <hi>Iacob,</hi> hee had a promiſe that hee ſhould preuaile with men, ſith he had preuailed with God, and that hee ſhould not now bee called <hi>Iacob</hi> any more, one that takes men by the heele, but he ſhall be called <hi>Iſraell,</hi> one that ſo wreſtles with God, that preuailes with him. When <hi>Iacob</hi> receiued this promiſe, and did fully truſt in God for his deliuerance, yet hee was ſlacke in prouiding all things that might pacifie <hi>Eſau,</hi> nay who could haue vſed more wiſe and good meanes then he did, but ſtill honeſt meanes, for ſtraight he ſends him a preſent to aſſwage his wrath, and ſends them out all together, but ſets a diſtance twixt one and other, that ſo this pauſe might make him digeſt them the better, &amp; his wrath might by little and little goe out, otherwiſe the flame might haue beene ſo great, that it would haue made him deuoured &amp; conſumed all, if they had run to him all at once, and then hee bids them all to make legs, and doe obeyſance, and call him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29174:34"/> my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> in great wiſedome and diſcretion: for giue a couetous man wealth inough; and an ambitious man honour inough, and you may leade him whether ye will. So did <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe, when God had promiſed him to beſtow vpon him all that were in the ſhip, hee would not neglect the meanes, for when the marriners would craftily haue gotten them away, in the boat, he would not ſuffer it, but tels them, that if they went away, they ſhould bee all drowned, and ſo they ſhould indeed, for as God had appointed to ſaue all, ſo hee had appointed to ſaue them all together, and by thoſe meanes. So for our feeding, hee that would ſay, hee truſts that God would feede him, yet would not ſtirre his hand to put meat into his mouth, all men would ſay that hee counterfaited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for hee that truſts that God will feede him, will eate that meat which God hath appointed to feede him. So for that man which hopes for a crop, hee will not ſit at home and be idle, but hee that truſts that God will giue him a good harueſt, will vſe all meanes, he will plow, and ſowe his ground, &amp; leaue nothing vndone, and he that vſeth this meanes in conſcience to God, ſhewes that he doth truſt in God. So for the ſoule, if you ſay I truſt God will giue mee euerlaſting life, and ſaue my ſoule, then you will pray, then you will heare the word, then you will meditate vpon the word, and receiue the ſacraments; otherwiſe, if you will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the miniſters of God, and bee troubleſome to thoſe that teach you, and care not at all to pray, or doe any ſuch thing, theſe words bee but winde, you doe not truſt that God vvill ſaue your ſoule, what euer brags you make. And in truth though there bee many among vs that will ſay, they truſt to bee ſaued, as well as the proudeſt (as they that be proud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, alwaies thinke that other men are proud) yet they doe but deceiue their owne harts, they haue no faith in God for their ſaluation, for if they had, they would pray, and confer, &amp; meditate, &amp; keepe themſelues vnſpotted of this wicked world, and doe other things which God hath appointed as meanes of ſaluation, and hath no more promiſed to ſaue any without them, then that any ſhould be fed without foode.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:35"/>
                  <p>A ſecond note of this true confidence, is not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, when vve vvant the meanes, as vvhen we haue them, we will not truſt on them, ſo vvhen vve want them, we vvill not be diſmaid, if we put our confidence in God, for the hart is neuer diſmaid till the hope bee gone, and if God bee our hope, then ſo long as he remaines, our comfort remaines. But this is the miſerable corruption of our nature, that if all theſe outward things be gone, then we ſit downe diſcontented and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thinke that our caſe is deſperate, and vve are vndone, but if riches and outward matters flow in, and wee haue the world at will, then as the rich man in the goſple we ſay, though not in word yet in deede, <hi>Soule take thine eaſe, now thou haſt ſtore laid vp for many yeeres.</hi> And why vvould he giue his ſoule allowance to take it eaſe, not becauſe his hart vvas full of gods promiſes, for that had beene a good reaſon, and a ſound rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: but becauſe his barnes were full of corne, and this vvas to vvithdraw his hart from God, for who euer promiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more fafetie one whit for his vvealth, makes an idoll of his wealth, and ſets it in the roome of God.</p>
                  <p>Therfore <hi>Iob</hi> proues by this, that he did truſt in God, for he did not greatly reioyce in it wealth, hee was not verie glad that he had much gold, and many cattle and groundes, for he knew God did not loue him one jott the better for all that, nor all his wealth could keepe one croſſe from him, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life one minute of an howre, and therfore he did not much reioyce to ſee theſe thinges come in by heapes, and ſo when all was gone, hee had ſoone made his accounts, <hi>God hath giuen, God hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> when I had them I was not the better, I did not truſt in them, and therfore now they are gone, I am not much vexed, it was no part of my greateſt happineſſe to haue them, nor is no part of my greateſt ſorrow that I haue ſo ſuddenly loſt them. But this our diſcouragement and whining and murmuring, when we want the meanes, ſhewes that we truſt not in God, but in them, for if we liue at Gods finding, who muſt prouide for vs, no mans life conſiſteth in his riches ſaith Chriſt, if God bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29174:35"/> our father and he muſt find vs, why are we not content with his promiſe? what though he keepe thinges in his owne hand, becauſe we know not how to vſe them. But this is the matter we would be our owne gods as it were, &amp; be at our own find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; in this matter we be farre more fooliſh then our owne children, for they keepe no ſtirre, and doe not trouble them ſelues to think how ſhall I doe to bring the yeare about, how ſhall I get prouiſion for the next yeare? or what if ill weather come, and ſo many doubts, but they are merry and freſh, and thinke not of theſe matters, but make account that their fathers will ſee them prouided for, and will not ſuffer them to want any thing, and therfore when they neede they goe to them, and make account that all is well, &amp; they ſhall haue it. And why ſhould not we do ſo to God, if we did in truth as we ſay we doe, account that hee is our father, and truſt vppon him, and giue but ſo much credit to him as our children doe to vs, why ſhould not wee thinke our ſelues ſufficiently prouided for, if wee haue his promiſe, if wee could indeede come to make him our truſt, thus we ſhould vnloade our harts of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment and diſquietneſſe, and liue farre more cheerfully, then now, by reaſon of our vnbeleefe and diſtruſt wee doe, or can doe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſigne to know whether we truſt in God or not, is to examine whether we ſeeke his loue and fauour, for that vvhich any man makes his truſt, that he doth moſt labour to obtaine. What doth any man ſpeake of moſt in the day, and thinke of moſt in the night, and ſeeke after moſt in all his life? If it be lucre? then hee truſtes in his lucre. So that man that placeth his happineſſe and ſeekes his felicitie onelie in pleaſure, he will moſt ſeeke and ſtriue to get his pleaſure, and is moſt vexed if it be taken from him. But if one truſt in God, then he would moſt labour to get the loue &amp; fauour of God, becauſe he knowes he can haue nothing from him ſelfe, or any other, but onely from god; as in Pſ. 62. 11. 12. Hee ſets downe two cauſes why we muſt not truſt in man nor riches, that is, in any outward thing, for power belongs vnto God, &amp; mercie
<pb facs="tcp:29174:36"/> belonges vnto God: All the men in the world, and all the riches in thee world, haue no power to helpe vs, vnleſſe god put it in them, for all power is his owne, and ſo for mercie, there is no kindneſſe in any man or angell which they haue not from God, no man nor angell can ſhew vs any kindneſſe, vnleſſe God giue them that kindneſſe, and if they doe, wee muſt confeſſe that it comes from him. Since then all power is reached from Gods hand, and all mercie is deriued from him, that nothing either can help vs, or if it could, yet would help vs, but ſo far as he puts both the power and will into it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that beleeue this, cannot chooſe but ſeeke Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, for then they are aſſured that nothing can be able to hurt them; yea, God can make all things, ſo far as it is profitable, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and readie to doe them good.</p>
                  <p>So much concerning the firſt commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which ſhewes vs whom we muſt worſhip, namely God, and wherin this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſteth, namely in a ſound knowledge of him, &amp; from this knowledge, in louing and fearing and truſting in him, with all our hart and ſoule.

The commandement containes a prohibition, in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image, nor the likeneſſe of any thing in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth, thou ſhalt not bow to them, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them.</hi> Theſe words containe the prohibition, forbidding vs to haue any Images to repreſent God, or to help vs in his worſhip, or to haue any ſuperſtitious or will worſhip, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to pleaſe him the better. The reaſons ratifieng the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29174:36"/> are two, one drawne from the vengeance of God againſt Idolaters and ſuperſtitious perſons, in theſe words, <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a Iealous God, viſiting the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the children, to the third and fourth generation of them that hate mee.</hi> Shewing Gods power in that he is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and a ſtrong God, as the word ſignifieth, and his will that he is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God: the ſimilitude is taken from a jealous huſband that can abide no light behauiour of his wife, but he will be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on it. So God cannot endure that any one that is his ſhould once looke to Images, or ſuperſtition, for if any doe, as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſtrength, he is able, ſo he is willing alſo to reuenge it on the ſonnes, and ſonnes ſonnes, to the fourth generation of ſuch as doe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the reward that God will beſtow vpon all ſuch as worſhip him purely, hating Idolatrie and falſe worſhip, that he will not onely bleſſe them, but theirs, to a thouſands. Neuer forgeting to ſhew mercy vnto thoſe that worſhip him purely, ſo that all their poſteritie ſhall fare the better for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image, nor the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any thing that is in heauen aboue.</hi> Firſt, in that God doth ſet downe ſo largely and ſo plainely, &amp; in ſo many words this commandement, he ſhewes how exceeding readie vve are to fall into the breach of it. Hence then we may gather this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that our nature is wonderfull prone to Idolatrie, and we are verie apt and readie to worſhip God falſely and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, for if it were not ſo, then why vvould not God content himſelfe to be as ſhort here as he is in moſt of the reſt: but we ſee for this and the ſaboth, how largely he ſets them downe, &amp; how he mounds and fenceth them on euerie ſide, with ſtrong reaſons; vvhich doth declare that he knows vs verie willing on any leaſt occaſion, to breake out from keeping of them: as we may mark here. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt make to thy ſelfe no Image:</hi> No, might ſome carnall man ſay, indeede vve vvill make no Image of any earthly thing, for theſe cannot ſet out God well enough, but for heauenly things, thoſe be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent;
<pb facs="tcp:29174:37"/> therefore to preuent this, God ſhuts out all excuſes, &amp; ſaith, that no man muſt make the Image of any thing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or in earth, or in the ſea, or in any place vvhatſoeuer. But yet fleſh vvould ſhift and ſay indeed it is true, vve muſt make no reſemblance or Image, or peece of an Image of any thing, but this is ment that it muſt not be done to that intent to giue any diuine vvorſhip to the Image it ſelfe, and to honour that as God, but vve may make theſe Images to help vs in vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God. Nay, ſaith God, thou ſhalt not bow downe nor vvorſhip them. j. neither giue them the greateſt honour nor the leaſt honour, nor any honour at all: ſo that God meets vvith euerie obiection, that our fleſh might haue no pretence of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this commandement, left it.</p>
               <p>Then the grieuous threatning that God vſeth to affright men from it, ſhewes that they are eaſie &amp; vvilling to be drawne vnto it, and that there is a ſtrange promiſe and inclination in euery mans nature, to this ſinne of falſe vvorſhip. So in Deut. 7. 25. 26. God labours vvith the people of Iſrael there, that they ſhould not in the land of Canaan vvhen they met vvith Idols couered vvith gold and ſiluer, couet or touch one parcel of the plate, or meddle vvith it, for if they did, it vvould inſnare them, it vvould make them remember the Idol, &amp; from remembring fall to liking, and at length to vvorſhip it; therefore it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to God, and he that vvill keepe a peece of gold of the Idoll, it is the next vvay to make him grow a vvorſhipper of the Idoll, vvhich that God is ſo carefull to remoue the leaſt occaſions, that might draw them to Idolatrie, ſhewes that men be vvonderfully bent and enclined to this idolatrie that God hates; and this appeares by the example of the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> vvhich vvere the church of God, and the ſeede of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for, for all the vvorld elſe, there vvas nothing elſe but falſe vvorſhip, &amp; the vvhole earth vvas ouerwhelmed vvith a ſea of Idolatrie; but theſe Iſraelites vvere but a vvhile among the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians, and vve ſee how ſoone they vvere infected vvith their diſeaſe, but vvhen God had puld them out of that hell of the world, that vvas ſo full ſtuffed vvith all ſuch abhomination, &amp;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29174:37"/> brought them into the vvilderneſſe, vvhere they vvere alone, &amp; no people elſe to prouoke them to it; yet vvhen <hi>Moſes</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them vvas away but fortie daies, then they tooke liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the luſt that had bene ſmothered by his preſence, now braſt forth, and they gaue themſelues &amp; all that they had moſt part of them, to Idolatrie, and to a calfe. And after vvhen God had brought them into the land of promiſe, and they had bene ther a vvhile, they could no ſooner haue any little ſpace of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and eaſe, but preſently they runne a madding after the Idolls of the land, ſo that God vvas faine almoſt continually to keepe them vnder vvith afflicton and trouble. And then after vvhen <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> had raigned, one vvould haue thought that in that ſpace all reliques and remembrance of Idolatry had bene quite baniſhed &amp; ſwept away, ſo that no man ſhould euer haue perſwaded them to fall to vvorſhip calues againe. But no ſooner had <hi>Ieroboam</hi> parted vvith the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſet vp two calues, but vvithout any ſtay the vvhole tenne tribes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally became vvorſhippers of calues, ſo that the two calues vvhich he ſet vp, could doe more harme then all the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and examples that vvas in the dayes of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> could doe good to keepe them from Idolatrie. And vvhen <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had a little eaſe, he began to ſet vp Idolatrie, and then the people quickly yelded vnto him; ſo that both <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> vvere quickly polluted and ouerrun vvith falſe and Idolatrous vvorſhip. But after vvhen <hi>Hezekiah</hi> came, hee vvas a good man and ſtood for Gods vvorſhip, and ſo neere as he could, ſwept away all monuments of the Idolatrie of <hi>Iudah;</hi> yet ſhortly after, vvhen <hi>Manaſſes</hi> came vp, the people vvere turned the vvrong way againe, and then they grew more mad then euer before; for then he would kill all that would hold vp their heads for Gods true worſhip, and would not yeld to his inuention, ſo that he fild <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with innocent bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from corner to corner. So we might ſee it among our ſelues in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, no wal or window, or houſe, or church, but it was ful of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, for when God withdrew the light of his ſpirit a while, all was ouerwelmed with Idolatrie; ſo prone is our nature to this
<pb facs="tcp:29174:38"/> ſpirituall whoredome.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this is, to teach vs to auoyd all meanes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that may draw vs vnto this filthie ſinne. In which thing when <hi>Salomon</hi> was not verie circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect, but would marry with ſuperſtitious wiues, how quickly did he grow ſuperſticious like them. And <hi>Amaziah</hi> when he had ouercome the <hi>Edomits,</hi> &amp; put them to flight, ſo that they were conſtrained to leaue their Gods, and flye for their liues, yet the verie looking on theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls did infect him: for as the eyes of an harlot, and looking on her will infect one with vncleanneſſe, ſo the looking on an Idoll will pollute an ignorant and blinde hart, and bring it to confuſion. But <hi>Dauid</hi> did otherwiſe, for when he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Philiſtines, and had them now in chaſe, ſo hard as they were driuen to leaue their gods and runne for their liues, yet he left purſuing them, and had rather ſtay, for he found a greater work then ſlaying his enemies, becauſe he knew that ſuch was the corruption that was in his men, and himſelfe, as that theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls might haue done them more harme, then all the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins could; and therefore that none might be infected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by them, he and his men tooke them all &amp; burnt them with fire.</p>
               <p>Therefore if wee haue any care of our ſelues, and to keepe our ſelues from idolatrie, beware of the companie of idolatrous perſons, for as an honeſt &amp; chaſt woman cannot bee long in the companie of adulterers, but ſhee ſhall be ſtayned with their impuritie, and ſhall get ſome blot by their filthineſſe, ſo it is impoſsible that one ſhould conuerſe long with idolaters, and not get ſome taint of their ſuperſtition. For as an adulterer will firſt ſtriue to draw the wiues minde from hir huſband, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his lawes and dealings as hard and vniuſt, and afterwards endeauour to draw to his owne lure, ſo it is with theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall adulterers, firſt they will doe what tkey can to bring one in diſlike with Gods pure ſeruice &amp; with his miniſters &amp; miniſtrie, as indeede our loue of Chriſt, and his word, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is not ſo hote for the moſt part, but that a few idle cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and falſe accuſations will quickly coole it, and then haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29174:38"/> drawne vs from the true worſhip of God, wee are eaſely caught and perſwaded to any thing, ſo that no opinion can be ſo fantaſticall and hereticall, but if the author of it can bring vs in diſlike with Gods ſeruice, and his miniſters, wee ſhall bee ready inough to imbrace it, and to follow it. But ſith our nature is ſo prone and inclinable to this ſinne, wee muſt not come in the companie or place where idolaters and idols bee, nor let our eyes once looke vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if wee doe, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leaſt that which hath poyſoned and infected others, may poiſon and infect vs alſo.</p>
               <p>Alſo this ſerues to confute the raſh boldneſſe of many, that nothing conſidering their owne nature, nor the filthineſſe and poiſon of idolatry, dare ſay that none ſhal be able to infect them or hurt them: indeede many may ſay to their ſhame, that none ſhall make them worſe, for howſoeuer, it cannot be but ſome addition will bee to their ſin, yet they be ſo bad already, that they can hardly be made much worſe by any companie, yet many ſuch there be, ſo bold &amp; foole-hardy, that thinke it a childiſh thing to feare, leaſt one ſhould be drawne to worſhip an idoll; what ſhould I bow to an image, or looke for any good from a ſtocke and a ſtone? but what will they ſay of <hi>Salomon,</hi> was hee a foole? did hee want wit? nay hee was fild full of all wiſedome, and was beloued of God yet when hee would be familiar with idolaters, he could not keepe himſelfe, but he was ouertaken with idolatrie. And <hi>Amaziah</hi> a man in the beginning of his raigne, that walked outwardly in the vvaies of God, and was for other matters a good and valiant prince, when hee would but looke on theſe adulterers &amp; idols, he was caught, though it ſeemed he had many things to keepe him back, for he had then experience of their weakenes, how that they could not help the Edomits, as after the Prophet tolde him. Therfore this is not courage in many, that will not care to go into the houſes of idols, to looke on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; gaze on their ornaments &amp; pictures, they are not afraid to go to ſee &amp; heare the maſſe, &amp; ſuch like things, indeed a vagrant &amp; a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate, that hath nothing, cares not whether he goes, it is all one
<pb facs="tcp:29174:39"/> with him to goe by night or by day, to goe in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous places as the ſafeſt, not becauſe he hath more courage &amp; ſtrength, but becauſe he that hath nothing, can looſe nothing, and ſo theſe vagrants and runagates in religion, that haue no pietie nor feare of God, they care not to bow and ſtoope and doe any thing to idols, but he that knowes his owne frailtie, and his nature what it is, and hath any thing to looſe or keepe, will take heed and beware in what places and company hee comes, leaſt hee take hurt and infection by them. For men muſt not thinke that miniſters haue leaſt ſtrength &amp; courage of any other, or are the moſt daſtardly and weake men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vvill not willingly come in ill company, &amp; among ill perſons &amp; heare ill words, but they know the curſe of God on thoſe that doe ſo, and they know their owne weakeneſſe and frailtie, and in this regard, as euery one hath more vertue and more godlineſſe, ſo he will more beware of any thing that may hurt him, or infect him. So much for the generall, in that hee ſtands ſo largely in forbiding all manner of idols, and all manner of vvorſhip, ſhewing how apt wee are to ſeeke ſhifts in this point.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any idoll.</head>
                  <p>IN that God firſt forbids the making, then the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of idols. The doctrine that we learne from hence is, that he that would auoide idolatrie, muſt auoide idols, as in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall marriage, thoſe that would auoid adulterie, muſt auoid adulterers, ſo in the ſpirituall marriage thoſe that will keepe themſelues from idolatry, muſt keepe themſelues from idols. Therefore the holy Ghoſt himſelfe 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>Babes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Idols,</hi> meeting with a ſecret obiection that might bee made. Indeede I hate idolatrie, but yet to haue idols, to put me in minde of God, and to beautifie the place, that I truſt is no ſuch perill? Yes it is, beware of idols, if you will be freed from idolatrie, put away all prouokements and inducements to it. Now of theſe idols ſome are more damnably blaſphemous, &amp;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29174:39"/> moſt directly againſt this commandement, and thoſe are ſuch as are made to repreſent any of the three perſons in Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, or holy Ghoſt, and theſe what euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or purpoſe one hath in ſetting them vp, are ſimply euill. Therefore Deut. 4. 12. <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſhewes the people, that vvhen God came purpoſely to ſhew his power neere vnto them, and to ſpeake in their eares, yet hee ſhewed no image nor reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of himſelfe, but onely they heard a voice; and therefore in any caſe they ſhould not goe about to make any image to repreſent God vnto them. So Iſai. 40. 18. <hi>Whereunto will yee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee? what ſimilitude will yee make of me?</hi> There he ſhewes the cauſe of making of images to reſemble God, is becauſe we cannot conceiue of him, and his greatneſſe ſo as we ſhould, for if heauen and earth, and all things in heauen and earth be compared to him, they are not onely nothing, but leſſe then nothing, and therefore what thing can they finde to ſet forth Gods Mageſtie, vvhat compariſon is betwixt a ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and a bodily, betwixt a thing infinit and finit, betwixt that that containes all things in himſelfe, and that which is leſſe then nothing. Therfore it is a blaſphemous debaſement of his Mageſtie, and lifts not vp our harts vnto him, but drawes downe our harts from him, to conceiue carnally of him, as of thoſe things which we ſee. If we ſhould ſee a man haue ſnakes and toades and adders in great account and reuerence, and if wee aske him why he gaue ſuch honour to theſe things, why, becauſe I ſet them vp as pictures of my prince, I but is there no other thing to ſet out your prince? theſe be not fit things nor comely, to put you in remembrance of your ſoueraigne, who will not ſay, that this were a great diſgrace to the prince: But now, there is a thouſand times more agreement, betwixt the greateſt prince and a toad, then betwixt God and an idoll? for the toad is a creature of God, as well as the prince, but an idoll is the worke of mans fingers; a toad hath life and ſence excellent gifts, and wherein it ſomething reſembles the prince: but to ſet God out by any Idoll, him that is infinit in wiſedome by a ſenceles thing, him to the vvorkmanſhip of
<pb facs="tcp:29174:40"/> mans hands, that cannot ſufficiently bee conceiued by all his owne workes, what a ſhamefull and miſerable diſgrace is this vnto his Mageſtie: but yet heere ariſeth an obiection, that ſome make; indeede for God the Father, and the holy Ghoſt they bee ſpirits, and cannot be repreſented to vs, by any thing, but what ſay you of God the Sonne; hee tooke vpon him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, may not one make an image of him? But to this vve may anſwere, that it is vnlawfull to make an image of Chriſt, becauſe we cannot chooſe but in painting or making any image of him, wee muſt needs leaue out the chiefe part of him, which is his diuinitie, for it is the Godhead that makes him to be Chriſt, and what is this, but to ſeperate thoſe things which God hath vnſeperably ioyned together, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; and in ſo doing, vvhat difference doe we make betwixt Chriſt and the theefe that did hang vpon the croſſe with him; that therefore is a vvretched reſemblance, but if vve vvould ſee an image of Chriſt, looke vpon poore chriſtians, that walke vp and downe amongſt vs, for they be fleſh of his fleſh, &amp; bone of his bone, &amp; there is ſome reſemblance of him; for they haue a body and a reaſonable ſoule, as hee had. But for the Idoll, he that vvill ſay hee can be better put in minde of Chriſt, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing vpon a picture painted on the vvall, or an image hanged vp in ſome place, then by loking on poore chriſtians, for whom Chriſt ſhed his bloud, and in whom hee dwels continually by his ſpirit, he ſhewes himſelfe to be a blinde and ignorant man. Sith then Chriſt is both god &amp; man, and the maine thing that makes him Chriſt is his godhead, let vs know that it is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impietie to make an image of Chriſt, ſith we can no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that, that makes him Chriſt. But if we wold ſee God, &amp; ſee Chriſt, let vs looke one him, according as hee hath reueald himſelfe in his word, for ſo Chriſt is cald the engrauen forme of his father, that as he which would know what is grauen on the ſeale, neede but looke vpon the waxe, and there he ſhall ſee it: So he that would ſee God, let him looke on Chriſt as he is ſet out to vs in the word, and there hee ſhall ſee his power his wiſdome, his mercy, his truth, &amp; all his properties. So much of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29174:40"/> the firſt and moſt notorious kinde of idols. Another kinde of idoll there is, not ſo preſumptuouſly wicked, &amp; in ſuch an high degree of impietie, and that is to make an image or picture of gold or ſiluer or wood, or any ſuch matter, to be put in mind of God, &amp; helped the better to worſhip and ſerue him. For this putting in minde, God hath ſhewed what an idoll will put one in minde of, and what an image will teach, Habak. 2. 18. <hi>What profiteth the image? the maker thereof hath made it an image, and a teacher of lies.</hi> Hee ſhewes indeede that images be teachers, and as they call them lay mens bookes, but then hee ſhewes what leſſons they teach, namely lyes, and then in the next verſe, hee ſhewes vvhat one ſhall get by being a ſcholler of theſe teachers. viz. the curſe of God: for ſo he ads, <hi>Woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that ſaith to the wood ariſe, and to the dumbe ſtone ariſe, it ſhall teach thee,</hi> I but will ſome ſay, no man will be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as to ſay to the ſtone ariſe: But indeede they doe ſay ſo, for in that they kneele downe to them, and knocke their breaſts before them, and creepe vnto them, all this implies that they hope to ſpeede the better by that wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſtone, and by that meanes to get themſelues ſome good: and this is all one, as if they ſhould ſay ariſe, awake and goe. We would count him an abſurd fellow that vvould ſay, I vvill goe to yonder ſtone, and ſpeake to it, and intreat it that at my requeſt it vvould walke vp and downe a little; but now vvhoſoeuer goes to it, kneeles before it, kiſſeth it, ſet a candle before it, or any ſuch like, is euen as abſurde, for in ſo doing he ſhewes that he thinkes that ſtone can ariſe, and hath ſome power to bleſſe him, &amp; do him good, therefore God giues him his vvages for his worke, and ſaith he is accurſed.</p>
                  <p>So in 106. Pſal. from 35. to 39. ver. Hee ſhewes the cauſe, progreſſe, and reward of this idolatrie in the Iewes: they ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelues with idolaters, vvhat came of that? then they learned their manners, and vvhat then? that vvas their ruine. There hee ſhewes, that they did not root out idolaters, as God commanded them, but would grow in acquaintance with them, and by that meanes learned their waies, and their manner of
<pb facs="tcp:29174:41"/> ſeruing God, till at length they became ſo zealous &amp; ſo hot, as that they would offer their owne children to the idols, indeede to diuels, for they would imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; that which he was content to haue done, that they wold do indeed, he was willing to offer <hi>Iſaac</hi> to god, but they went further, they offred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp indeed to their idols, &amp; ſo thinking to pleaſe God, they did that which hee abhorred, &amp; therby defiled and ſtained themſelues and the land, for as Gods ordinances doe clenſe &amp; purge men, ſo the inuentions of the fleſh doe polute and defile, and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon his wrath flamed againſt them, ſo that hee gaue them vp to their enimies that hated them, becauſe they gaue themſelues to that which he hated. So Pſa. 135. 15. <hi>The idols of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are ſiluer and gold, euen the worke of mens hands,</hi> they bee but the wormanſhip of man at the moſt, and therefore inferior and leſſe then men, for alwaies the worke is inferior to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it; and then he diſcribs them, <hi>They haue eyes and ſee not, eares and heare not, feete and goe not, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo ſaith hee, <hi>are thoſe that make them, and thoſe that truſt in them,</hi> j. hope by their meanes to fare the better, thinke by kiſsing, knocking, kneeling, &amp;c, vnto them, to get any good; Idolaters and idoll makers, will you know what they be? they haue eies and ſee not, eares and heare not, mouthes and ſpeake not, they haue no vſe of ſoule or body, for if they had they would neuer bee ſo baſe minded, as to hope for any good from ſtocks and ſtones, or looke to bee helped of them. Therfore they are euen as blockiſh and fooliſh as the idols themſelues. But heere may be an objection to; Did not <hi>Salomon</hi> make Cherubins in the temple, and did not <hi>Moſes</hi> make the braſen ſerpent? Why then ſhould idols and images be ſo odious and hatefull vnto vs. But to this we may anſwere, that God forbids to make an image to our ſelues: now <hi>Salomon</hi> did not make the Cherubins to him ſelfe, but to God, becauſe he had a commandement and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God ſo to doe. So for the braſen ſerpent, <hi>Moſes</hi> made it not of his owne minde, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the direction of God, ſo that was no more an inuention of man, then the ſcriptures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are; for he was commanded of God how to make
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29174:41"/> it, of what figure, in what place, &amp; to what vſe. So for the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, God appointed them likewiſe, to ſignifie, that God had his wings as it were, ſpred out, that whoſoeuer would come to him in the Church, ſhould haue protection and ſhelter from him, at all tymes. But this makes nothing for making of idolls, to worſhip god by them. For becauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> made an image at Gods appointment, therfore, may we make one at the idols appointment? and if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet vp a braſen ſerpent by Gods direction, may we by the direction of fleſh and bloud? that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not. But for that very ſerpent that God had commanded to be ſet vp when men would looke on it with to great a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and had it into great requeſt and honour; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſo bold as to pull it downe and grinde it to powder, and this is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a thing of commendations in him. We muſt make no images to our ſelues then, but if God bid vs, then we may, for then we make them to God, and then if God ſay who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe things at your hands, we may anſwere with comfort, thou didſt O Lord.</p>
                  <p>Sith then the worſhipping of images is the worſhiping of idols, as it is ſaid in the Pſalme afore named. 136. For he that doth Gods work he worſhips God, and he that doth the diuels work he worſhips the diuell? and ſith all idols be condemned in gods ſeruice, becauſe they haue no warrant from God, nor he hath not appointed any ſignification of them. This ſerues for the reprouing of all thoſe that haue bowed downe vnto them, kiſſed them, or vſed any homage vnto them. For in <hi>Iſai,</hi> 66. 3. He ſets downe this as a note of an vnregenerate man <hi>to bleſſe an idoll,</hi> one need goe no further for the note of a wicked ſinner, then if he bleſſe an idoll. For by worſhipping it, in this commandement, he meanes not to account it as God, but to think that by any reuerence done before the idoll, one ſhall get ſome help, that this ſhall be a meanes of good, to doe this, is ſpiritual whordome. For ſo in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42. 8. He ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, I will not giue my glory to an other.</hi> One had better therfore dye the death, then vſe any bodily geſture of reuerence to an idoll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this the three Children knew full well in <hi>Daniell.</hi> For
<pb facs="tcp:29174:42"/> when the King commanded them on paine of death to fall downe, he did not binde their ſoules but onely their bodies, yet they would not; one would think they might haue done that, and done it in their harts to God, but they knew that if they had defiled their bodie vvith the leaſt bow, it would haue drawne Gods curſe vpon their ſoule and bodie; and therefore they durſt not doe it. Therfore ſith this is ſpirituall whordom, thoſe that haue done it muſt repent for it, and know that they haue infected their ſoules with a damnable ſinne, for which if they doe not throughly repent, it is ſaid, that when times &amp; occaſion ſhall ſerue, they will fall to it as freſhly as euer before, for then it is not the feare of God that hath repreſſed it, but the poſitiue law doth a little reſtrain it, which if it be remoued, their luſt will breake foorth as much as euer before; as it vvas ſeene by the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> in the wilderneſſe, therefore we muſt be truely humbled, for it, and labour for aſſurance of pardon. And though men will ſay they did it with a good intent &amp; in good meaning, and in loue to Chriſt, yet all theſe excuſes will not ſerue the turne. It were an ill excuſe in a wife to ſay ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her husband exceedingly, and therefore in his abſence ſhe muſt haue others to ſee them, and looke on them, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, and all this for loue to her husband, the husband would ſcarce think well of this loue; yea, it would be abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vnto him. And it is much worſe to kiſſe an idoll, and bow downe to it, and then ſay, it was for loue to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>An other vſe of this is, that we muſt labour to get the true and ſound knowledge of God, out of his word, and a feruent loue of him; for till then a man is in daunger to fall to idolatry. But if one ſee Chriſt in his word, and know his ſpirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, then they ſhall ſay as the church, in <hi>Hoſea. 14. What haue we to doe any more with Idoles, we haue hard God and ſeene God.</hi> For then we ſhall ſee better and more excellent things in him, then can be found in any image: but till this we are not well fenced againſt idolatrie, as in the naturall mariage, the wife is ſure from adultrie if ſhe loue her husband, but till then ſhe lies open to adulterers, ſo betwixt chriſt and vs; then are we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29174:42"/> ſafe from idols, when we haue gotten a feruent loue of Chriſt. Many will boldly ſay, what bow downe to an idoll? kneele to a ſtocke or a ſtone; ſure I ſhall neuer doe it, but as good as you haue done it, but what cauſe or what reaſon haue you to thinke you ſhall not? haue you ſeene Chriſt Ieſus diſcribed in his word? haue you ſeene him, &amp; receiued his bodie &amp; blood in the ſacrament? if one haue ſeene his excellent beautie in theſe meanes, he ſhall abhor an idoll, as an vgly thing, and if ones ſoule loue Chriſt and ſeeke after him in theſe meanes, he will neuer fall to this filthineſſe, but loth and deteſt it, but elſe hee is in continuall daunger to fall to ſpirituall whordome, what euer he can ſay now, when the times doe not ſerue. Thus much for the groſſe and direct breach of this commaundement, by making an image to repreſent god, which is impious, or to help one in his worſhip which is idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond breach of this is ſuperſtition, when one doth not goe to ſtockes &amp; ſtones, but vſeth thoſe waies and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in worſhipping God, which are not commaunded of God in his word, but bee the appointment of men, for Mat. 15. 9. Chriſt ſaith that they worſhip him in vaine, teaching for doctrines mens precepts. If it haue no further beginning then mans braine, God will giue no bleſsing to it, yea hee ſends a curſe vpon it, for curſed is hee that ads any thing to Gods booke, God will add ſo much to his plagues. And the reaſon is, becauſe he makes himſelfe wiſer or better then God. For if God be perfectly wiſe, then he knew beſt what worſhip would pleaſe him, and if hee be perfectly good, then he would reueale vnto vs, what euer hee knew fit for vs to practiſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is a great iniurie offred to God, when we will let his deadly enimies, haue the ordering and appointing of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, rather then himſelfe. A king would thinke it a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, that his ſeruants would not ſerue him after his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſome baſe fellow that were a profeſſed enemie ſhould ſet downe, what meats he muſt haue, and in what manner hee muſt be ſerued, and all his attendance and prouiſion: but much more abſurd and injurious it is, that we will let fleſh and bloud
<pb facs="tcp:29174:43"/> beare the ſway in his worſhip, for theſe doe joyne with the diuell, and are enmitie to God. And if wee will haue this preheminence in our houſe, and that our ſeruants muſt do that which we bid them, not what they themſelues thinke good, for hee is a good ſeruant that doth his maſters will, not his owne, then why ſhould not we thinke it right, that god muſt be lord in his houſe, and we muſt doe his ſeruice after his appointment and not our owne.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues to condemne the Papiſts, that are moſt guiltie in this point, and haue defiled the whole worſhip of God with their owne inuentions, and ſuperſtition; as in prayer, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dead, and for the dead, and by making other media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors then Chriſt, in all which God may, and will ſay vnto them, who required theſe things at your hands? So likewiſe in the ſacraments; for the Lords ſupper, the bread muſt be conjured and croſſed, and likewiſe the wine, or elſe they thinke it is not ſufficiently ſanctified: but where hath Gods word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any of theſe things? If they be ſo needefull then, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne God for want of wiſedome, that could not ſee it, or if they were not needefull, how dare they bee ſo bold as to adde them to Gods ordinance? So in baptiſme, they haue added ſpittle, ſalt, and creame, and ſuch trompery, all which is wicked and abhominable, and comes vnder this, who required theſe things at your hands? So for the miniſtrie, how haue they corrupted it, by Popes, Cardinals, Abbots, Monkes, Friers, &amp; the reſt of that crue, and then they haue appointed their Prieſt to offer a ſacrifice propitiatorie, for quicke and dead, whereof there is no mention in the ſcripture of God, and therfore there can bee no bleſsing vpon them, for they proceede from the fleſh, and not from the ſpirit, &amp; ſprang from out of the earth, &amp; did not come downe from heauen. Therefore alſo we are to be exceeding thankfull vnto God, that hath freed vs from all theſe things, and that wee are taught to worſhip God aright, taught to pray in the holy Ghoſt, and haue the word pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and ſoundly deliuered vnto vs, hauing ſuch a teaching as God hath commanded, and to which he hath alſo annexed a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29174:43"/> bleſsing, and ſo for the ſacraments, that leauing theſe toyes, they are adminiſtred in that ſort, that God hath commanded.</p>
                  <p>So much for the things forbidden in this commandement, namely, idolatrie and ſuperſtition. Now as this falſe worſhip is forbidden in this commandement, ſo the contrary, namely the pure and holy worſhip of God is enjoyned, and wee are commanded heere to ſtand for, and to practiſe all the good meanes whereby God hath commanded himſelfe to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. Theſe are either more ordinary as prayer, hearing, &amp; reading the word, and receiuing of the ſacraments and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The leſſe ordinary, are faſting, which is to be vſed to the intent that we may the more ſoundly humble our ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and be reconciled vnto him, and is then ſpecially to be practiſed, when that we would be freed from ſome iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that we either feele or feare, or elſe when wee would obtaine ſome ſpecial bleſsing that we doe earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. It was commanded in the law once a yeere, that they might be acquainted with it, and haue a perfect reconciliation with God. A ſecond leſſe ordinarie meanes of Gods worſhip is vowes, which are to be vſed on ſpeciall occaſions, when to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen our ſelues againſt ſome ſinne, or in performing ſome dutie, vve doe binde our conſcience, to auoide all occaſions that may draw vs into the one, and to vſe all good meanes, that may further vs in the other. The third is lots, which is apart of gods worſhip, to bee vſed in matters of waight, to the deciding of controuerſies to the ending of ſtrife and contention: an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of which we haue in the Acts. 1. Where being to chooſe an Apoſtle in <hi>Iudas</hi> ſtead, and not knowing the fitteſt they committed the matter to Gods ſpeciall piouidence, in caſting lots. So in chooſing of a King, which was a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: becauſe no ſtrife and contention ſhould ariſe of any tribe, towards other, therefore they caſt lots and ſo choſe him, whom God pointed out as it were by the finger. And the like they did in deuiding the land of Canaan, leaſt any emulation or enuie ſhould ariſe among them, they vſed Gods owne hand as it were in giuing euery tribe his inheritance. In ſuch matters
<pb facs="tcp:29174:44"/> of waight and moment, then theſe lots muſt bee vſed for theſe ends, as a good ſeruice of God. The laſt leſſe ordinary part of Gods worſhip is an oath, which is in like matters of waight to be vſed. Sith theſe things are as ſtricktly commanded, as the other are forbidden, this condemnes the corruption and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our times.</p>
                  <p>Many thinke that if they bee free from idolatrie and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, then they haue kept this commandement, and haue not broken this, <hi>Thou ſhalt make to thy ſelfe no grauen image.</hi> This is not ſo, for one may bee a damnable breaker of this commandement, for all this, for God commands as well as forbids, and we muſt turne from dumbe idols, to ſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, or elſe there is no true conuerſion. Many can ſay, that they do not pray ſuperſtitiouſly, but do they euer pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly? they ſpend no time in vaine repetitions, but do they ſpend any time in faithfull and holy petitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praying in the holy Ghoſt? they reade no Popiſh bookes, but doe they read the booke of God? they come not at Maſſe, but do they reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently receiue the Lords ſupper? they haue left off Popiſh faſts, like inough, for we are falne from Poperie to plaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie: but doe they faſt a chriſtian faſt? as they did it ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe they doe it conſcionably? in caſting downe themſelues and celebrating a ſabboth vnto God, to confeſſe their ſinnes and craue pardon for the ſame. But for want of theſe things, many want the bleſsing of God, which they might haue, and are breakers of this commandement, becauſe they bee not ſo dilligent in vſing the good meanes of their ſaluation, as they were in vſing the ill meanes of their deſtruction; and are not as carefull to plant in the holy worſhip of God, as to pull vp the ſuperſtitious, ſo that ſuch are as well guiltie of the breach of this commandement as idolaters, they for doing that they ſhould not; we for not doing that we ſhould; they for vſing falſe worſhip; we for not vſing the true worſhip of God: but then we ſhall bee true worſhippers of God, when we ſhun and hate all falſe worſhip, and put in practiſe all the parts of this true worſhip of the true God.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:29174:44"/>
                  <p>So much of the commandement, forbidding all kinde of falſe worſhip, and commanding the contrary, viz. with all reuerence and conſcience, to performe, loue, &amp; ſtand for the true worſhip of god. Now follows the reaſon of this commandement, drawn partly from Gods iudgements againſt all falſe worſhippers, &amp; from his mercy &amp; kindeneſſe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that worſhip him in truth. The judgement towards the breakers of this commandement is, that he will not onely plague them, &amp; take vengeance on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their owne perſons, but he will execute his wrath alſo on their ſeed &amp; poſteritie to the third and fourth generation. Which is therfore ſet downe becauſe it is a verie hard thing to perſwade euen that this is ſo great &amp; fearefull a ſin, when in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as they ſay, they ſerue God after another manner, then hee hath warranted &amp; commanded. The reaſon taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to thoſe that are obedient, becauſe we are very ſlow and ſlack to the right ſeruice of God, is to allure &amp; prouoke vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that god will not only bleſſe ſuch an one in his own ſoule &amp; body, both in life &amp; death, but his bleſsing ſhal reach further euen vpon many generations in his poſterity, ſo that God will neuer leaue bleſsing thoſe that with an vpright hart worſhip him in truth according to his word.</p>

                  <head>I am Iehouah thy God, a iealous ſtrong God.</head>
                  <p>IN theſe words calling himſelf our God, he implies that ther is an euerlaſting marriage betwixt god &amp; vs, &amp; therfore as it is a foule fact, for a woman after hir marriage, &amp; the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to defile her body with filthy adulterers. So it is a much more hainous &amp; abhominable thing, for any man or woman, after his couenant with God, to follow idols and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not contenting himſelf with the perfect beautie of Chriſt. Then where he ſaith a iealous God, hee compares himſelfe to an husband, that as hee loues his wife moſt tenderly &amp; dearely, whilſt ſhe remaines chaſt &amp; faithfull, ſo is he moſt offended &amp; prouoked if ſhe deale lewdely and trecherouſly with him, ſo Chriſt Ieſus hath loued vs moſt dearely, and giuen his bloud
<pb facs="tcp:29174:45"/> for vs, but if we deale not chaſtly with him in this caſe, he will be as a jealous man, whoſe moſt abundant loue being abuſed doth burſt forth into the ſtrongeſt hatred, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith that jealouſy is the rage of man, &amp; the eie of iealouſy ſeeth all things.</p>
                  <p>Then he cals himſelfe a ſtrong God, ſhewing his power, that hee hath abilitie as willingneſſe to puniſh, in that hee cals himſelfe jealous, it declares that he wants not will and cauſe to powre vengeance on them, and in that hee is a ſtrong God, hee is of might ſufficient to plague and confound thoſe that wickedly break his couenant. From al this diſcription wherby God hath ſet out himſelfe vnto vs, to bee our God, and a iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, that cannot abide any ſuch filthineſſe, and a ſtrong mightie God, that is able to execute his wrath on the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: we may and muſt take courage and comfort, to ſtand for Gods pure worſhip, againſt all idolaters and idolatrie, and all manner of ſuperſtition; being that he is our God, one that hath bound himſelfe in couenant to defend and protect vs, as alſo hee is iealous, which carries a flame of loue to all thoſe that be faithfull, as well as an exceeding deteſtation of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, and then he is a ſtrong God, not ſtrong with an idle kinde of ſtrength that lies hide within him, and neuer is put in practiſe, but hee doth vſe his ſtrength to the maintayning and protecting of all ſuch as are true friends to him, and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his worſhip. Which is for comfort of thoſe, whoſe friends and ſuch from whom they haue their maintenance, are popiſh and will hate them and be enemies to them, if they be enemies to ſuperſtition, and loue God and his worſhip: but feare not that, God is a ſtrong God, if they will not help, hee will, they haue no ſuch power againſt you, as god hath for you, ſo long as you continue vpright in his worſhip. This is alſo for the terror of all idolatrous and ſuperſtitious perſons, that haue many things to vphold them, and are well friended and ſtrong defended, but yet miſchiefe ſhall be their end in the end, becauſe he is ſtronger then all men, that ſets himſelfe againſt them, and whom they prouoked euen to iealouſie by their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe; who ſees all their wayes, as hee ſaith, pull out thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteries

                  <p>FIrſt it may bee objected, how God can in iuſtice doe this and puniſh the children for the fathers fault: But to that one may anſwere as God doth in Hoſea. 2. 2. ſpeaking to the Iewes, hee bids them plead with their mother, comparing him ſelfe to an husband, he ſhewes that there is no fault in him, but all the blame lies on the adulterous mother, for as an husband may without any fault put away the wife, that hath dealt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſlie, and hir adulterous broode to, ſo God may iuſtlie plague and forſake both the parents, and the wicked children of wicked parents.</p>
                  <p>Now his vengeance vpon the children of Idolatrous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is ſhewed eſpecially in theſe things.

But the doctrine that wee may gather hence is, that vngodly parents are the moſt deadly enemies vnto their children, as in Exo. 34. Where God ſets downe his name moſt comfortably, and the aboundance of his mercy, yet he ads this withall, <hi>Holding not the wicked innocent, but viſiting the ſinnes of the fathers, on the children.</hi> This the example of wicked <hi>Ahad,</hi> doth euidently
<pb facs="tcp:29174:46"/> proue, for in that he would ſhed the innocent bloud of <hi>Naboth;</hi> in that hee would commit idolatrie and ſerue <hi>Baalim;</hi> who could haue done a greater wrong to <hi>Ahabs</hi> poſteritie, then <hi>Ahab</hi> did by theſe things: for hence it was that the kingdome was taken from his houſe, and that his children about ſeauenty perſons, had their heads chopt from their bodies, and were made as dung, and all his kinsfolkes &amp; acquaintance fared the worſe for his wickedneſſe. And ſo <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that ſeducer of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> hee thought by his idolatry to haue eſtabliſhed the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to him &amp; his, ſo that it ſhould neuer haue ben take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him, and his ofſpring, but was it ſo or not? nay this ouerthrew him and his houſe, this was the bane of all his, for becauſe hee made Iſraell to ſinne, therefore God ſwept away him and his ſtocke as dung from the face of the earth, that none remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them, as one would doe with an vncleane and filthie beaſt, which if he abide long in a place, will defile the houſe with his dung, and the place cannot be cleane and ſweet, till both the beaſt bee remoued, and his dung ſwept out: ſo was <hi>Ieroboams</hi> ofspring as excrements of an vnpure beaſt, that did ſo polute the land, as it could not bee cleane vntill they were all ſcoured away.

                  <p>This ſerues to confute thoſe parents, that thinke and goe about by oppreſsion, by wrongfull and iniurious dealing, and ſuch wicked courſes to better the eſtate of their children, and hope by theſe meanes to make their ſeede great vpon the earth after them. Nay this is the way to bring the curſe of God, and conſequently deſtruction vpon their familie. If men did but giue credit vnto the word of God, that ſuch vilde practiſes would ouerthrow, and not build vp their houſes, and that they did by theſe things pull downe the plague of God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon them and theirs, it would keepe them from enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues by wicked wayes, and make them take heede how they filled their houſes with the riches of iniquitie, for feare leaſt they ſhould fill them alſo vvith the reward of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,

                  <p>For theſe ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth, doe crie vp to heauen, they make an exclamation in Gods eares, and hee vſeth not to repell this crie with a deafe eare, but hee heares it to the ruine of thoſe againſt whom the crie commeth, for after this crie of their iniquitie, followes their crie and howling for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. As Gods daiely Iudgement vpon encloſers and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in our owne land, ſhewes it; for when they begin to moleſt poore men, to vnpeople townes, to ſeeke how they may dwell alone in the land, this incloſing doth but exclude them and theirs, ſo that if men would but marke and obſerue it, they ſhould ſee before their faces how God plagues their ſinnes in them ſelues, and their howſes. This muſt teach vs likewiſe to be humbled and to craue pardon for the ſinnes of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they doe ſend an ill breath of Gods curſe vnto vs to. And ſo we ſee in <hi>Daniell</hi> 9. he doth not onely confeſſe his owne ſinnes and the wickedneſſe of the people, then aliue, but he is wonderfully caſt downe and grieued, for the ſinnes of their anceſtors and predeceſſours, and of the Kings, Preiſts and Prophets that went before them.

But he that ſees his fathers euill way, and will either juſtifie them &amp; defend them in word, or elſe by his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe mantaine them, hee makes vp the meaſure of his fathers ſinnes, that both may bee layd together, and bring a double plague vpon their heades.</p>

                  <p>IN that God cals Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, hatred of him, this doctrine may bee learned from thence that all falſe loue is hatred, for Idolaters pretend that they loue God aboue all, and more then all; why they can finde in their harts to beſtow their ſonnes and daughters vpon him, and is not this zeale? No, falſe loue is true hatred, and in that they doe thoſe things that God hates and forbids; what euer their pretence bee, they are haters of God. So Pro. 13. Hee ſhewes that a fond parent, that ſpareth the rod, hateth his childe; why but they doe loue them, and are ſo tender ouer them, as that they cannot finde in their harts, to giue them due and fit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, why but this is hatred. So in Leuit. Hee commands to admoniſh our brother, and not to hate him in our hart, ſhewing that if one be ſo carnally affected to any man, that he cannot tell him of his ſinne, hee is loath to grieue him by a ſharp reproofe, and to reprehend him ſo, as that he might be brought to repentance, he that is ſo tender harted, hath an hard hart againſt his friend, &amp; this is the worſt hatred that may be.</p>
                  <p>This then ſerues to confute ſuch people, as will ſay of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, oh they bee good honeſt men, and though they haue not ſo ſtrickt a regard of his worſhip as he commands, yet I hope they loue God, and haue a good hart to him; nay they bee not honeſt perſons, neither doe they loue God, but they hate God. For this is as if a wife ſhould ſay, indeede in mine husbands abſence, I muſt haue another man to keepe mee companie and to lie with mee, and to bee familier with mee, but yet I loue mine husband, the husband nor any man elſe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count finally of this loue, yea they would thinke the wife ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather then loued her husband: And ſo thoſe that muſt looke one idols to help them in their deuotion, they muſt haue ſome image to gaze on, that they may bee put in minde of God, they doe it, that they may remember God, but God will giue them but a ſmall reward for this loue, yea they ſhall bee
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29174:47"/> accounted of him, as profeſſed enemies of his name: So for thoſe parents that are ſo kinde to their children, and loue them ſo deerely, that they cannot bring them vp in nurture and in correction, and in the feare of God, they cannot croſſe them, nor goe againſt them in their ill courſe; ſuch a parent is a moſt mortall foe, as often the children feele afterwards, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doe recompence, for they hated them with a falſe loue, but the children reward it with a true hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo hee that will not offende his friend, nor trouble him with telling him of his faults, but rather ſmooth vp all, and flatter him, and ſpeake faire words, hee is a grieuous enemie, and yet who is there almoſt that doth not delight in ſuch enemies, and makes more of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and eſteemes them more welcome, then a true faithfull friend that ſeekes his ſoules health, and will not ſuffer him to fling himſelfe headlong into deſtruction; but we muſt learne to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all carnall loue to God and men, as that which is the moſt pernicious hatred.</p>
                  <p>This muſt alſo teach vs not to joyne our ſelues in ſocietie or in marriage with idolaters, for this is to joyne our ſelues to thoſe that hate god. And for this <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> was reproued, what ſaith the prophet, wouldeſt thou loue thoſe that hate God, &amp; help them? what hadſt thou to do to be ſo friendly &amp; familiar, with Gods enimies? Yet if one had come to <hi>Ahab</hi> and tould him that he had hated God, he would haue defied him, and ſaid, that he had loued God as well as the beſt, but that is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what <hi>Ahab</hi> would ſay, ſo long as God accounts him an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ſhould haue had no ſociety nor freindſhip with him: ſo that they are much to be condemned, that will ſeeme to haue ſome care of religion them ſelues, and to looke to their owne waies that they be good, but yet they can be familiar, &amp; make friendſhip with Idolaters and profeſſed ſuperſtitious perſons; why but is not this an hatred of God, and are not you then ſubiect to that reproofe of <hi>Iehoſhaphat?</hi> what wouldſt thou loue them that hate me? No man will be known to be a familiar friend to an open traytor, that the King &amp; counſell hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a traytor, for feare leaſt he ſhould be tainted with ſome
<pb facs="tcp:29174:48"/> ſuſpicion of treaſon. And in deede he that will be ſo conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and ſo well acquainted with ſuch as God hath proclaimed traytors, thoſe that haue any ſpirituall wiſdome and true loue of God, may not without juſt cauſe vehemently ſuſpect him, as one that him ſelfe beares no great good will to God and his pure religion.</p>

                  <p>IN that that God promiſeth to ſhew mercie to thouſands of them that loue him, &amp; keepe his commandements, we learne that the beſt way for any man to do good to his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be godly him ſelfe, as the verie words of the commaundements doe carrie it. So Pſal. 37. 21. ver. <hi>A good man is mercifull and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp; his ſeede enioyes the bleſsing, &amp;c.</hi> After 29. <hi>The righteous ſhall inherite the land and dwell in it for euer.</hi> Not this in his owne perſon, for that were no bleſsing for a good man to liue ſtill in this world, but in his ſeede hee meanes. One would thinke the contrary, what is hee alwaies lending? ſtill doing good? why alas how ſhall his poore children doe, how ſhall they do, nay they be rich children &amp; ſhall do well enough, they haue a rich legacy left them, for they ſhall haue Gods bleſsing, for when he ſaith the bleſsing, it is more then if one had ſaid the whole earth, and all the world, for ſo one might haue and yet bee vnder the curſe, and liue and die a miſerable man, but he ſhall haue the bleſsing, all things neceſſarie for ſoule &amp; bodie, heauen and earth, for ſo much the bleſsing containes. So 112. Pſal. <hi>The generation of the righteous ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> If then the bleſsing of God be the cauſe of all proſperitie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and contrarie the curſe of God, the beginning &amp; ground of all miſerie, then ſo farre as we are good or ill, ſo farre doe we doe good or ill to our ſtock. For in Leuit. God threatens that if one be diſobedient to God and his commaundements, he ſhall be curſed in his ſoule and bodie, in his wife children and all that he puts his hand vnto, but on the otherſide, if one be vpright &amp; with a perfect hart, ſet him ſelfe to follow Gods

                  <p>Sith then God is ſo mercifull to all thoſe that loue him, and ſhew it in keeping this commaundement. This ſerues for the comfort of all ſuch, that be good children of good parents, though perhaps their parents, can leaue no great matter for outward things, yet if they haue laide vp many praiers for them in heauen, and leaue them Gods fauour for their poſſeſsion, they haue a good parentage, for they haue Gods bleſsing to truſt vnto better be the childe of a godly, then of a wealthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, for he that him ſelfe is a good man, and hath proceeded of good parents, is now poſſeſſed of a double bleſsing, for his fathers prayers and for his owne prayers, for his fathers mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and for his owne mercie to.</p>
                  <p>This likewiſe ſerues for the comfort of gods children, that haue many children, and little wealth, little goods to leaue them, but that is not the queſtion, what goods they haue, but if they be good, and labour alſo to haue their childen good, if they were thowſands of them, they haue the bleſsing of God, and that ſhall maintaine them well enough, thoſe that be bleſſed of god ſhall not want for ſignes of his bleſsing.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes indeede the godlyeſt parents haue wicked and vngodly children, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> had, but yet God will either cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them as he did <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes, ſo that thoſe which at the firſt he ſaw to be as prophane as any, hee liued to ſee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; verie holy men, and pillers of the church, or elſe if all be not good, yet God giues grace that ſome one of them at the leaſt ſhalbe holy, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had vngodly <hi>Iſmael,</hi> but yet he had godly <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> had prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> but he had holy <hi>Iacob</hi> to, and <hi>Dauid</hi> had wicked <hi>Abſalon,</hi> &amp; inceſtious <hi>Ammon,</hi> but yet with all he had godly <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nathan,</hi> or if none of the next of-ſpring be good, yet ſome of them that follow ſhall bee holy, the godlineſſe of the parent will ſhew it ſelfe in the bud ſooner or later, as in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> that ſucceeded him was at firſt a wicked idolater, yet good <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>

                  <head>Thoſe that loue him and keepe his commandements.</head>
                  <p>THat is, thoſe which haue ſuch a true loue to him, as doth ſhew itſelfe by the faithfull vſing of his pure worſhip, and by keeping not the duties of fleſh and bloud, but his commandements. So that heere God ſets down this, as a note of louing him to keepe his commaundements, whence this leſſon ariſeth, that the loue of God conſiſts in keeping his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but afore the doctrine be further declared, an objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be remoued, for one may ſay, what? doe you ſay that none loue god but thoſe that keepe his commandements, then I pray you where can you find one that loueth God, and who is this that is able perfectlie to keepe and fulfill the law of God. But for the abſoluing of this doubt, knowe that there is a great difference betwixt theſe two, to keepe Gods commandements &amp; to fulfill Gods commandements, for keeping noteth a truth, fulfilling a perfection, this perfection Chriſt onely had, but this truth, euerie chriſtian muſt haue, for euerie chriſtian man may ſo farre keepe Gods law, as that he ſhalbe both accepted and alſo rewarded, though not for the merits of the worke, yet for the mercie of him, that accepts the worke. But this true keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be knowne by theſe notes, firſt in keeping one, muſt aime at all, ther muſt be a full purpoſe and true deſire to keepe all, for if one lie in any ſin, &amp; breake any wilfullie, then the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; known breach of one, makes him guiltie of all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the obedience muſt be done willinglie, with a free &amp; cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hart, as <hi>Dauid</hi> bids <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſerue the Lord with a willing minde. Thirdly, the end of our actions muſt be good, to ſhew our loyaltie to God, to approue our harts to him in obedience to his commandements, that wee may bee bleſſed of him, and not for any other ende or intent of our owne, as to bee mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of men, and to merit by them, or ſuch like. </p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:29174:49"/>
                  <p>He that hath all theſe things keepeth the law of God; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede no man can fulfill it, neither is it required of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they ſhould: becauſe they be vnder grace, and not vnder the law, for the rigour of it. But for thoſe that bee out of Chriſt, this condition is propoſed to them, winne it and weare it, keepe the law in full perfection, &amp; haue happineſſe in full perfection, but breake it in the leaſt title, &amp; looſe your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: thoſe which are not in Chriſt are thus bound, but thoſe which are his members, &amp; that are made one with him by faith, are vnder grace, &amp; there is a more fauourable obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, not to fulfill the law in the extremitie of it, but to keepe the law in the vprightneſſe of their harts, and to doe ſo much as Gods ſpirit that is beſtowed on them, giues them power to doe.</p>
                  <p>But now to returne to the doctrine it ſelfe, whoſoeuer loues God, muſt in this manner as hath beene ſpoken keepe the lavv of God. This is proued 1. <hi>Iohn 5. 3. 4. This is the loue of God, that wee keepe his commandements.</hi> Is it ſo may one ſay? then that is a verie hard peece of worke, few can doe that, nay ſaith he, his commandements are not grieuous, for all that is borne of God ouer commeth the world, hee ſhewes that a chriſtian ſo farre as hee is regenerate, hee hath conquered the world, and then Gods commaundements ceaſe to bee burdenſome, for the things that make Gods commaundements heauie vnto vs, is our worldlineſſe and fleſhlie luſts which ſtriue againſt the ſpirit, but when Gods ſpirit which regenerateth vs, hath ſet downe and ouer come thoſe luſts, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Gods commandements are verie eaſie &amp; lightſome, &amp; we ſhall with as much comfort and quietneſſe obey them, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his innocencie, when wee are once trulie conuerted, according to the meaſure of our conuerſion. It is a moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious thing to a chriſtian hart, to obey the diuells comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, but it is moſt joyous to follow Gods. As if it were permitted to a chriſtian man, for the while, to ſteale, to lie, to commit adultrie, and to breake the ſabboth, or ſuch like, why, his ſoule would abhorre it, and hee would rather die
<pb facs="tcp:29174:50"/> then doe theſe things: it would bee ſuch a vexation vnto him, but now, to heare the word, to pray, to confer, to doe workes of mercie, and the reſt of this kinde, it is euen a recreation and delightfull ſport for him to doe them, for Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements are pure and holie, and doe delight the hart ſo farre as it is pure and holy. So <hi>Iohn. 14. 15. If yee loue me keepe my commaundements, and I will pray the father, and hee ſhall ſend you another comforter.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, hee that loueth mee beſt, and keepes my commandements moſt, ſhall haue trouble and miſerie, but let not that trouble him, for hee ſhall haue my ſpirit which will comfort him and ſuſtaine him in all his miſeries. But I doe keepe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and haue a care to bee obedient vnto Chriſt, then Chriſt ſayth, verſe 21. Hee that hath my commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and keepes them, one muſt firſt haue them afore hee can keepe them, haue them in knowledge and vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, haue them in memorie, haue them in Iudgement and affection, and then fall to keepe them in action; doe this, and then indeede you loue Chriſt, but many talke of louing Chriſt and what good freinds they bee to Chriſt, but try them a little by their workes, and you ſhall ſee that they neither haue Gods commaundements nor keepe them, and ſo farre as they faile in theſe things, ſo far they faile in the loue of god, and prouoke God alſo not to loue them.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues to confute thoſe diſordered perſons, in whom one can ſee nothing but open rebellion againſt Gods law, open breach of the ſabboth, and manifeſt contempt of Gods word, and yet tell them of it and come to aske them if they bee not aſhamed thus in the face of the worlde to proclame enmitie againſt God, then firſt they fall to ſhifting and cloaking, but if you come with ſo good proofe and ferret them out ſo ſoundlie, that they cannot denie it, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to their faces: why then this is next, what are you without ſinne, haue you no fault? doe you keepe all Gods Commaundements? yes, miſerable man, there are faults in the beſt. But this is blockiſhneſſe, for is there no difference
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29174:50"/> betwixt falling by frailtie and through infirmitie, and liuing and lying in a ſinne? and allowing ones ſelfe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of it: that frailtie is in Gods elect children, but this wilfull diſobedience and maintayning is in hipocrits, that God puts away and regards not, this hee will neuer put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, vnleſſe there be an amendement and greater ſoundneſſe: for ſuch perſons loue not God, and it is juſt if he plague them, and purſue them as his enemies.</p>
                  <p>This likewiſe ſerues for the great comfort of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that doe their beſt endeauour to keepe all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and that with a vvilling hart and good intent and minde, not thinking to merit any thing by them, for they know God muſt ſtill ſhew mercie euen to thoſe that loue him, and keepe his commandements. This I ſay comforts all them, for when hee hath done all hee can, hee comes ſhort and faileth, but yet God will ſhew mercie, this word may reioyce them, for hee will ſhew mercie, as if hee had ſaide, though you come farre ſhort of that you ſhould, and would, yet ſo long as your hart is true, God will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for hee requires not fulfilling but keeping, if one will ſtand to himſelfe, then hee muſt haue either perfection or confuſion, but if hee truſt to Chriſt, then hee is vnder grace, there is mercie in Chriſt, pittying and rewarding, rewarding all their good, and pittying and paſsing by their infirmities.</p>

But ſo ſlight a regard haue moſt men of God, that though his name be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and profaned, though he be diſhonored and vilified, they lay it not to hart, nor care for it, therfore leaſt men ſhould make no account of this ſo great a ſinne, becauſe it is a thing that mans lawes takes little or no notice of, hee ſets downe the puniſhment, that though the poſitiue law of men take no hold on ſuch perſons, yet the God of heauen and earth, will take ſuch in hand and deale with them himſelfe, hee will not commit them to the hands of inferiour officers, but himſelfe will ſee their execution done.

For that vvhich the wiſe men ſpeakes in the naturall family, is true alſo in the houſe of God, a wicked ſonne ſaith he, is a griefe to his father, and a ſhame to his mother; Let an hundreth rogues and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and runnagates, play the filthie perſons, the vnthrifts, &amp; the theeues, this brings no diſcredit to the father, no man char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the fault vpon him; he beares no reproch. But if his ſonne that is brought vp with him in the family, and is called after his name, ſhall doe any ſuch thing, himſelfe hath not onely a blot, but he brings alſo an ill report vpon the whole family, &amp; his father ſhall beare a great part of this diſgrace. So, let all the Atheiſt and papiſts, and carnall worldlings in the world, liue wickedly, and ſhew themſelues to be as they bee, filthy beaſts, goates and ſwine, without grace and the feare of God, it is no ſuch great matter, they beare all the blame themſelues, and the ſhame lights vpon their owne necks, God and his children and his religion, are no whit the worſe thought of, but the better ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the life of one kinde is compared to the other. But now let a profeſſor, fall into any wickedneſſe, one that makes a ſhew to be begotten of God by the immortal ſeed of the word, to be a childe of the church, a member of Chriſt, a temple of the ſpirit, let ſuch an one breake forth to ſome groſſe ſinnes, &amp; here will be matter for all the hel-hounds in a country, to talke of; now the diuel &amp; his lims will exult &amp; brag, now they ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and whet their tongues, the religion of Chriſt ſhalbe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, the profeſſours of religion taunted, euerie one ſhall haue this layde in his diſh that deſires to be a chriſtian, and the name of God, and the ſpirit of God ſhall not eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome blot of reproch: ho ſay they, theſe be your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, theſe be theſe holy men that be ſo full of the ſpirit, theſe be they that will be the holy ſaints of God, theſe be they that runne to ſermons and carry bibles, theſe be the fruits of their profeſsion, you may ſee what godly men they be, I warrant you they be all alike, neuer a barrell better herring, you may ſee by one what be the reſt. Thus we ſee what a great ſtaine religion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29174:52"/> hath among men, by the name of thoſe that be hipocritically religious, and liue vngodly lie, with-out the power of it, how they fill wicked mens mouthes full of ſlaunder, &amp; giue their malicious harts matter to ſet it ſelfe a worke againſt God, and Godlie men, and this was the ſinne of <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> they ſhould haue bene the Lords high prieſts, haue giuen ſuch good exhortations, &amp; haue ſhewed ſuch grace in their conuerſation, as that all men might haue delighted to come into the place of Gods worſhip, and to ſerue him, according to the law, but they were ſo wicked and ſo vngodly, and ſo full of filthineſſe, that the ſeruice of God by their meanes, was made hatefull, odious, and loathſome. Sith then this is ſuch an high taking of gods name in vaine, to be a bramble in gods vinyard. This ſerues for the confuting of thoſe men, that think if they can keepe their tongues from ſwearing and forſwearing, then they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit guiltie of the breach of the third commandement, if no man can charge them with an oath or periurie, they think they need not repent for taking Gods name in vaine. Not ſo, but let them know, that by an ill lyfe, by walking and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after a ſinnefull manner, they may prophane Gods name more, hurt religion more, and bring more griefe into the harts, &amp; ſhame into the faces of profeſſors, then an other by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand raſh oathes; yea, by groſe and open perjury. It is a great fault to abuſe the religion of God in lyfe, as the titles are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God in ſpeach, and therfore vnleſſe thoſe that be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led chriſtians, labour to be chriſtians, that their works be ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their words, and they ſhew forth the vertues of Chriſt, as well as take vpon them the name of Chriſt, vnleſſe they be careful to frame their life according to the line of Gods word, &amp; ſo to order all their carriage, that their conuerſation may be anſwerable to their profeſsion, and the fruit that ſhews it ſelfe in their lyfe, agreeable to the ſeede that is dayly ſowed in their harts, they are as groſe profaners of the name of God, and as lyable to the curſſe and vengeance of God, as he that ſweares many a vaine and idle oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſerues to inſtruct all men that would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:29174:53"/> chriſtians, and be accounted the ſonnes of God, to liue ſo, as that we bring ſome glory to God by our life. And this <hi>Paul</hi> bids the bond ſeruants. 1. <hi>Tim. 6. 1. Count their maſters worthy all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine may not be ill ſpoken off.</hi> Speaking to ſuch as were ſeruants to vnbeleeuing maſters, he bids them giue them honour and reuerence, not for any religion or goodneſſe that could be ſeene in them, for they were infidells, but for conſcience ſake, to Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whoſe place theſe maſters did ſupply; &amp; that becauſe if they did not thoſe, all the fault ſhould be layd vpon the name of God. But how doth he proue that Gods name ſhould be euill ſpoken of, becauſe, his doctrine ſhould be ill ſpoken, ſo that where euer the goſpel is ſlaundered, there God himſelfe and his name is diſhonoured. So in the ſecond of <hi>Titus, Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaking to ſeruants, wills them to ſhew all good faithfulneſſe, &amp; not to pick nor ſteale, nor to anſwere againe, and that for this reaſon, that they may adorne the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus. He would haue thoſe which are in the baſeſt eſtate, and in the loweſt condition of all men, euen ſeruants and bondſeruants, in their place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne religion, by their good behauiour, in that place. No place is ſo meane and of ſo ſmall account, but you may doe God good ſeruice in it, if he beautifie his profeſsion, by an vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pure conuerſation; for nothing can glorifie God more in all this world then when thoſe that will belong and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto him, ſhew what houſhold they be of, by their works, and he that wilbe eſteemed the ſonne of God, muſt doe more good work then one that is onely the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> this will ſtop the mouth of wicked men, and muſſell them vp, that they ſhall not haue a word to bark out againſt chriſtians and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie: yea, this will beget a good liking in their harts of that word and that religion, which works ſo good effects in the lyfe of them that hold it. As in the family, let the children be good and temperate and modeſt, and behaue themſelues gently and humbly to all, then they doe not onely get good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation to themſelues in the harts and mouthes of men, but they are an honour to the houſe of which they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29174:53"/> come, and to the parents which begat them, &amp; a crowne to all their friends and brethren, that thoſe which be enemies, cannot for ſhame giue out an ill word of ſuch a man whoſe children be ſo well brought vp and behaue themſelues ſo orderly. So is it in the church, in gods houſehold vpon the earth, would one bring credit to God his father, would he cauſe the church to be praiſed, and all his brethren and fellow members to rejoyce, &amp; to be well reported of? then let him, ſhew forth the vertues of Chriſt, let him liue worthie his vocation and calling, let him cauſe his light ſo ſhine forth in the darkneſſe of the world, let them not keepe their vertues in their owne boſome alone, but let the brightneſſe and the warmeth of them lighten vpon all thoſe that liue with him; and if he ſo doe, he ſhalbe honoured himſelfe euen in the conſciences of wicked, but eſpecially he ſhall win great reuerence and reputation, to the name of God, to chriſtians and chriſtian religion; and though ſome enemies be reprobates, and therefore irreuocable, yet he ſhal make them dumbe and ſtop their foule mouth, that their furious barking ſhall either not be heard, or if it be, ſhall not be heard. And wheras others that are yet in their preſent eſtate enemies, but in election gods children, may ſeeme for a time perhaps to be hardened &amp; not to ſubmit themſelues, yet afterwards this good example will work, and the ſeede will appeare in the fruit, for ſaith <hi>Peter, They ſhall glorifie God in the day of their viſitation.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Happely for a time it will ſeeme vaine to ſhew any good example to thoſe that be not good men, for they wil it may be, be ſo far from profiting &amp; glorifying god, as that they will rayle and blaſpheme. Be it ſo, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you ſee no better ſucceſſe, yet know, that if theſe men be gods, when he hath ſoftned their harts and opened their eies, and conuerted their ſoules vnto him, and reſited them with his good ſpirit, then they ſhall magnifie God, and praiſe him; then they ſhall ſay, bleſſed be God that euer I liued in ſuch a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian family, that euer I was vnder ſo good a miniſter, I thank God that euer I was acquainted and did conuerſe with ſuch a man or woman, by whoſe gratious behauiour, I was brought
<pb facs="tcp:29174:54"/> the better to like of religion; Now the old ſeed that ſeemed to lye dead vnder the clods, reuiueth and ſprouts vp, now the fruits of all good precepts and good admonitions, begin to appeare. Therefore we muſt ſtriue to be ſuch good children, for better it were, neuer to profeſſe religion, then thus to profeſſe it, and liue like a worldling. If there grow brambles in Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, the axe of Gods vengeance meets with them ſtraight, &amp; they of all other ſhalbe moſt fearefully and horribly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if one will be a brier then, let him keepe himſelfe in the wild waſt, and not preſſe into Gods garden, for if he doe, moſt vndoubtedly, he ſhall be cut downe &amp; caſt into the fire. Thus much for the firſt diſhonouring and taking gods name in vaine by lyfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond followes by ſpeach, and that firſt without an oath, and that by ſpeaking vnreuerently of Gods word, titles, attributes, or workes, without due regard and eſtimation of the thing one ſpeakes. Firſt of the word, in ſpeaking of it idly, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie, vainely, to pick out needeleſſe queſtions, and to ſhew ones wit in learning, in diſcourſing and amplyfieng matters, or in objecting againſt the truth (whether one thinke not ſo, yet it is an abuſe of the word) I ſay by this vaine putting vp ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, in oſtentation of their nimble wit, and ripe head, that they can put downe the miniſters, as many proud, fooliſh, vaine fantaſticall, mad-headed youths will brag, that they can holde argument with the beſt preachers, and ſet them downe, &amp; put them to a <hi>non plus,</hi> euen out of the ſcripture. This vaine and fruitleſſe jangling is a great abuſe of the ſcripture which is one excellent part of gods name, by which he will bring vs to the knowledge of himſelfe, when one hath no care to make the end of his ſpeech the glory of God, for high talke becomes not a foole, it is an vnſeemely &amp; abſurd thing to heare a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wicked beaſt, be prating &amp; diſcourſing of Gods word, that doth not account of it as hee ſhould, why ſhould he haue it in his mouth, that hath it not in his hart. Firſt let him get the law of God, written in his owne hart, and then let him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth in wiſedome, and inſtruct others, as God ſaith
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29174:54"/> in Deut. 6. 6. <hi>Let theſe words bee in thine hart, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them continually.</hi> Firſt then let one labour to haue the vſe of Gods word in himſelfe, and to make it his owne, and lay it vp in his hart, and then hee may with fruit and comfort bring it forth and confer of it to others, elſe if one bee an idle talker, and a fooliſh vaine diſputer of that which hee neuer had any experience and working in himſelfe, the more hee ſpeakes the worſe it is, the more hee diſhonoureth God, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the word, and hurteth his owne ſoule. Firſt then Gods name is taken in vaine, by the abuſe of his word, in curious &amp; fruitles prating of it. Therefore one muſt neuer talke of gods word, but that hee may bring ſome glory to God, and ſome good edification to men, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your moſt holy faith,</hi> vnleſſe this bee our ſcope when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee take Gods word in our mouth, to build one another vp in godlineſſe, wee peruert the word of God, and prophane his name. Secondly Gods name is polluted by vs, when vvee ſpeake of his word in mockage, after a jeſting and a ſcoffing manner, as thoſe did, of which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, that derided the doctrine of the laſt judgement, ho ſay they, all things continue a like ſince the fathers, when will hee come, <hi>q. d.</hi> Wee heare a large diſcourſe, and heere is much a do among theſe preachers now a daies, about the great day of judgement, a terrible day that muſt come, wherein all men muſt be cald to account they ſay for their workes, but where is it? where is the truth of their fearefull tale? when comes this judgement? wee would faine ſee it once: and thus becauſe God doth not preſently ſit vpon the bench, and paſſe ſentence, and ſee the execution done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and reward euery one, the wicked by caſting them to hell-fire, and the good men by taking them vp to the ioyes of heauen; fooliſh vaine men that haue no faith, make a merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a ſport to laugh at this doctrine. So in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he told them of death, the Atheiſts fell to flouting, come ſay they, theſe prophets tell vs wee muſt all die, if wee muſt die then, let vs take our pleaſure whilſt wee may; let vs eate &amp; drinke, and bee merry, to morrow ſoule and body and all muſt
<pb facs="tcp:29174:55"/> come to nothing, there will bee nothing left, well, we will plie it while time ſerues, and thus theſe vilde irreligious beaſts, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the exhortations of the Prophet to a mocke. So, many lewd perſons in theſe daies are ready to abuſe the words of Chriſt, where hee ſaid, if one giue thee a blow on the one eare, turne the other to him, to deride Chriſtians; nay ſay they, pray you turne the other eare to. Shameleſſe perſons; will not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of Chriſt feare them from the abuſe of ſuch words, as hee with his owne mouth vttered? Theſe be the words of God ſpoken and penned by the wiſedome of the holy Ghoſt, for the direction and inſtruction of his children, not for euerie prophane ſwaggerer, and drunken beaſt, to roule vp and down in his filthie mouth, to moue laughter with them: and this is a common thing among fantaſticall fellowes, that deſire to be thought wittie and conceited, that if any place of ſcripture ſerue their turne, to gird or quip one another or ſuch like purpoſe, they had rather god ſhould looſe his glory, and gods word the grace and authoritie of it, then that they will looſe their jeſt; &amp; thus that which God appointed to edifie their ſoules in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they peruert to ſtirre vp themſelues and others to fooliſh and wicked, and prophane laughter. So thirdly the word of God is abuſd in a moſt groſe and notorious manner, when one brings it in the defence of any ſinne or error, or hereſie, which is to preſume to wreſt Gods weapons out of his hands, as it were, and beat him with his owne ſword. This is a greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the ſacred word of God, and more hurtfull and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous, then either ſwearing or forſwearing. Thus the diuell did moſt damnably prophane Gods name and word, when he miſuſed that, to make Chriſt goe out of his way, that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to encourage all Gods children in their waies, thus ſetting as it were an ill-fauoured ſhape vpon Gods word, that it may ſeeme to agree with his diuelliſh temptations; ſo let wicked &amp; voluptuous liuers that ſpend all their time and labour in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing vaine and fond ſports and games, and ſuch fooliſh and fleſhly delights, as makes them no whit more ſeruiceable to God or the common weale, nor doe any good to their owne
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29174:55"/> ſoules or bodies, or any mans elſe; let ſuch men I ſay, be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and told that this kinde of liuing is not allowable, it will not hold out before god, man was made to bring glory to god, and doe good in this world, not to bring pleaſure to his fleſh, and liue idly in the world, and therefore they muſt repent and amend, you ſhall haue an excuſe ſtraight, Gods word muſt bee brought as a defence, they doe not breake Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without warrant out of the ſcripture, if you will beleeue them; what ſay they, would you haue a man liue without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? doe you not allow recreation? why the ſcripture doth afford a man recreation, and then a number of places muſt be brought in, for recreation, to maintaine their voluptuouſneſſe. But vaine man, doth not the ſcripture command a vocation, and the recreation as an help to further in it; now if one may aſke you that ſtand ſo much for recreation, what is your occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? what ſore trauaile is that that wearies your body? what earneſt ſtudie troubles your braine? that you muſt haue ſo much refreſhing, and ſo much recreating, it muſt bee ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry painefull labour, that needes ſo much reſt, to make one able to performe it: it is a ſore labour indeede, for it is the ſeruice of luſt and the diuell, two hard maſters.</p>
               <p>But this turning of recreation into a vocation, or a vexation rather, is not alowable by Gods word. How dareſt thou then bee ſo impudentlie audacious, as to rob God of his treaſure, to maintaine thy filthy luſt, and defile his holie word, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending thine vnholy practiſe. So likewiſe come to a couetous perſon, touch him a little with a rebuke, for his wringing and oppreſsion, ſhew him that the loue of the world is enmitie to God, and that couetouſneſſe is idolatrie, then comes in this place of ſcripture which muſt ſalue all, what hath not God commanded a man to labour in his calling, doth not God ſay hee is worſe then an infidell, that prouides not for his familie, and ſo all muſt goe vnder the name of good husbandrie, and thrift and prouiding for his familie. But conſider thou that ſtandeſt thus for thy labour, God will haue thee labour, but not to ſerue the diuell in thy labour, take paines in thy calling,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:56"/> but hurt not thy neighbour by it, prouide for thy children &amp; lay vp, but lay vp a treaſure in heauen, prouide to bring them vp in the feare of God, and in ſome chriſtian vocation, firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that they may be chriſtians, and then one hath well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for them, ſtore vp mercifull workes, &amp; then the righteous is mercifull and lendeth, &amp; his ſeede injoyes the bleſsing. Thus God will haue one labour with godlyneſſe and prouide ſo for his children as hee prouides for his owne ſoule. So come to angrie and paſsionate perſons, they can haue ſome thing to ſay for their ſinne to, and that out of Gods word, when they haue broke out into fooliſh and vnaduiſed paſsions, tell them this is naught, anger reſts in the boſome of fooles, and the wrath of man fulfills not the law of God, oh but I pray you doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, be angrie and ſinne not: It is true hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but if thou wilt be angrie without ſinne, bee angrie firſt with thine owne ſinne, begin at home, &amp; condemne the follie that is in thine owne ſoule, or elſe thine anger is not holie &amp; ſpirituall, but diuelliſh fleſhlie and carnall. So al-moſt in all other ſinnes, there is ſcarce any other ſinne ſo bad, but vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſons will ſtand in defence of it, and if they can ſnatch a few words out of ſcripture, and teare them violentlie, from the true ſence thereof, vnto their owne luſt, they count this a matter of great wittineſſe, but in truth it is a matter of great &amp; horrible wickedneſſe, and a damnable prophaning of the name of god, when one can wreſt &amp; hale together manie places, and ſay much for his ſinne, it is not a note of more wit, but of more acquaintance with the diuell, for their tongue is ſet on fire of hell, it is tipped with hell fire, &amp; blowne by the ſtinking breath of Satan, &amp; when they haue ſaid all they can, they haue made their ſinne more grieuous, their hart more hard, and them ſelues more curſed, in that they haue done no thing all the while, but diſhonoured God, to make him a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of wickedneſſe, and his word a ſword for the diuell.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, the word of God is abuſed &amp; profaned, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to charmes and ſpels &amp; all kinde of ſorcerie, to cure ſuch perſons as be miſpoken as they tearme it, and ayr'd, as ſuch
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29174:56"/> fooliſh tearmes they haue, and to ſay the Lords praier or ſome place of ſcripture, to find things that be loſt, with many ſuch wicked thinges, this a ſinfull peruerting of Gods word. And wheras men commonlie excuſe themſelues for this ſin, becauſe the words be not ill, yet let them know, that when one abuſeth good words to a wrong end, they be euill words to him, and if the word of God be peruerted to ſuch an end, as he hath not appointed, they be the diuells words to him that thus peruerts them, and Satan is no leſſe daungerous an enemie, when hee comes like an angell of light, then if he appeared in his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: and this charming God himſelfe condemnes, &amp; in the law ſaith, that he will finde out ſuch perſons. So that, both theſe charmers and thoſe that goe vnto them be wicked abuſers of Gods name, and either, they ſhall haue no ſucceſſe in the thing they ſought for, or if they haue, it is a greater plague, for now they proſper in their ſinne, and their hart is made more hard &amp; incureable. And thus the word of God is abuſed. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt this abuſe is, that we labour to apply Gods word to the right ends that he hath appointed; and if we will know theſe ends, we may ſee them, 2. <hi>Tim. 3. 16. The whole ſcripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be abſolute, being made perfect vnto all good works.</hi> Heere hee ſhewes how we muſt imploy the ſcriptures of God, and firſt generally he ſaith, they be profitable, ſhewing in generall, that the word of God muſt neuer be medled withall, but for ſome profit, in all conferences wherin we bring in the word of God, and in all maner of vſing Gods word, this muſt be the cloſing and ſhutting vp of all, that there be ſome good done, that ſome body be the better for, that ſome fruit be reaped; where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is not the end, Gods word is not rightly applyed. Then perticulerly he ſhewes wherin this profit conſiſts; firſt to teach, j. to enlighten the vnderſtanding, that one may get more knowledge, and his minde is thus bettered. Secondly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, that is, to refute and beat downe hereſies &amp; falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions afore, to teach the truth, now to pul vp hereſies, that the
<pb facs="tcp:29174:57"/> judgement may be ſound. Thirdly, to correct, j. to reforme &amp; amend the offenders, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince ill opinions, to correct ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations. Fourthly, to inſtruct, j. to ſhew how one ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his ill manners, and how he ſhould doe good, as well as that he muſt forſake that that is ill; how to liue well, and how to haue ſuch a good conuerſation, that one may haue comfort in his lyfe and death. Theſe are thoſe ends of the ſcripture, to which whoſoeuer imployes it, ſhall not diſhonour Gods name, and hurt his ſoule, but glorifie God, &amp; himſelfe be made abſolute perfect, and readie to euerie good work. Thus much for taking Gods name in vaine by ſpeach, without an oath, but in vaine ſpeaking and other abuſing Gods word. Secondly, Gods name is thus taken in vaine, by abuſing his tytles, as God, <hi>Iehouah,</hi> Ieſus, Lord, and ſuch other. And that either in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as when one in the hearing of any odd matter or ſtrange report, ſhall breake forth into ſuch vaine wandring ſpeaches, good Lord, O Ieſus, O Chriſt, Lord haue mercie vpon vs, what a thing was that, wherein one names Gods titles, without any conſcience and reuerence of him. Therefore thoſe which haue done ſo, muſt repent. So likewiſe, we abuſe Gods titles in raſh petitions and imprecations, as, <hi>Sarah</hi> in a fuming chafe comes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaith ſhe, the Lord be judge betwixt mee and thee, and thus ſhe muſt needs haue a purchaſed ſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and God muſt come downe from heauen in all the haſt, none elſe would ſerue the turne, to redreſſe ſome wrong that ſhe thought ſhe had; what was the matter, vvhy, <hi>Hagar</hi> had dealt ſomething vnkindly with her, &amp; God muſt needs come to loke to this diſorder. But if God had come and hearing her raſh prayer, ſtraight made examination, and proceeded to puniſh the chiefe offender, who ſhould haue bene firſt plagued, who was the firſt mentioner of taking <hi>Agar</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not <hi>Sarah</hi> her ſelfe? what, muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> take her through her meanes and motion, and now when the matter falls out ill, ſhe will fall out with her husband. How could it fall out bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſith ſhe was the author of ſo ill a beginning. So that ſuch kinde of imprecations as to wiſh God be judge, in auengme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29174:57"/> raſhly and haſtely, is a great diſhonour to God; as likewiſe in curſing, as Gods vengeance ouertake you, and ſuch like horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeaches, when God forſooth, muſt needes become their officer to reuenge their quarrell, and ſerue their malicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. So likewiſe to praiſe God and giue God thanks for an euill thing, as <hi>Saul</hi> at the wickedneſſe of the <hi>Ziphims,</hi> when <hi>Dauid</hi> had deliuered them and done them good; now they to curry fauour with <hi>Saul,</hi> and to get his good will, came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him to <hi>Saul,</hi> and to diſcouer where hee was, that <hi>Saul</hi> might take him; hee breakes out, bleſſed be you of the land, &amp;c. One might haue done a good dutie and diſcharged a good conſcience as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did, &amp; he would neuer thank God for that, but let one come and help him to bring his miſcheuous purpoſe to paſſe, then God be bleſſed, and much good thanks there muſt bee. But <hi>Dauid</hi> did not ſo to him that ſlew <hi>Saul,</hi> though he had bene a cruell and an vnjuſt aduerſarie. So for gamſters, when they couſen and rob one an other vnjuſtly of their mony, without conſcience and warrant, they might euen as well before God cut his purſſe, then forſooth God muſt be praiſed for their theeuerie, or I thank God I haue ſped well, I haue good luck. What, is God a gamſter, is he a dicer now, muſt he be at euery idle perſons beck, when he is robbing his neighbour? Monſtrous perſons, that dare be ſo impudent, they ſhall feele and ſee if euer God waken their conſcience in this lyfe, and if he doe not in the life to come, that it was a fault bad euough to take away ones goods in this manner, and far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they will dare to abuſe the name of God in it. Now the beſt medicine to preſerue vs from all theſe ſinnes and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Gods titles, is that which is ſet downe in Deutero. 28. 58. <hi>Feare the glorious and fearfull name of the Lord thy God.</hi> Feare it ſo, that one name it not, nor think not of it, but with great awe and reuerence, for if one be audacious, to take Gods name in his mouth, without feare &amp; due regard, God will lay plagues on him, and thoſe not ſhort and ſlight, ſore and grieuous, of long continuance and durance. And if one doe tremble and feare before God, thus he ſhall neuer abuſe his name.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29174:58"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods name is taken in vaine, by abuſing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and by abuſiue ſpeaking of them; as of his power, his wiſedome, mercie, patience, goodneſſe, and ſuch like, which are abuſd when we ſpeake of them carnally and careleſly, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſlie. As in the 2. Kings. 7. When the prince, on whoſe arme the king leaned, heard the Prophet ſay that corne ſhould bee ſo cheape, ſo ſuddainly after that extreame dearth, he ſaid though God ſhould make windowes in heauen, that could not bee ſo. Now to ſpeake ſo baſely of Gods power, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly as though his ſtrength were to bee meaſured by mans ſtrength, and God could not tell how to bring it to paſſe, becauſe hee could not tell how, nor ſaw no meanes; for there hee aludes to <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, <hi>q. d.</hi> if God ſhould raine corne as faſt as hee rayned water then, it could not bee ſo, but it could bee and was ſo, and hee ſaw it ſo, but had no good by it, for he was preſt to death of the throng, as a juſt reward of this his contemptuous ſpeach, &amp; vnbeleefe of gods power. So likewiſe his prouidence and wiſedome is abuſed, when one frets, and ſpeakes grudgingly againſt Gods worke, vnder the name of fortune and chance, oh what ill lucke was that, what ill-fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fortune; for either one muſt ſay that things come to paſſe by chance, hap as hap may, without any diſpoſing of Gods, &amp; ſo hee chargeth God to bee too careleſſe a gouernour, that lets all things runne at randome without counſell and aduice, when hee had made a world, to let it goe at peraduentures, and at randome, or if wee ſay that God gouernes all things, &amp; rules in the world, and appoints what things &amp; how they ſhal come to paſſe, then he chafes and murmureth againſt Gods gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnder the name of fortune, &amp; ſpeaking ill of luck, ſpeaks ill of Gods wiſedome, a propertie of his.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in abuſing any of Gods properties to defend euill, as is the common cuſtome of moſt men, if you reprooue them and admoniſh them of any fault, this makes them care for nothing; oh God is mercifull, true, God is mercifull, but to whom? to the penitent and humble perſon, that hates his ſinne and ſtudies to forgoe it; but hee is not mercifull to thoſe that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29174:58"/> loue their ſinne, and like their ſinne, and that haue a root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe in them, and make Gods mercie an incouragement to harten them in their ſinne, &amp; not to allure them to repentance, and make his loue and kindneſſe a protector to their lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſuch he will ſhew no mercie, but his wrath ſhal burne againſt them, to the bottome of hell. So that in ſpeaking of Gods attributes, ſpeake of them with reuerence and to that good vſe for which God hath reuealed them.</p>
               <p>So laſtly, Gods name is taken in vaine, without an oath, in ſpeaking vnreuerently of his workes, either thoſe admirable actions of God within himſelfe, as his election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when vaine man becauſe his ſhallow conceit and fooliſh braine, cannot comprehend how God ſhould bee juſt if hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any to damnation, or how it were not long of him if hee ſhould decree of their deſtruction before, that it were as they ſay a plaine wrong, and God could not maintaine it, for this weakeneſſe of his, that cannot reach to the depth of theſe things, hee will therefore denie them, and ſay there bee none, whereas hee ſhould rather with ſilence and reuerence wonder at this hidden ſecret, and not prie into it, as <hi>Paul</hi> in Rom. 10. did, hauing ſpoken ſparingly of it, hee breakes out in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſo concludes, <hi>O the deepeneſſe of the riches of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c.</hi> This is an horrible prophaneſſe. So for the outward workes of creation, &amp; of redemption, and the paſsion of Chriſt, when one can ſpeake ſo lightly and without all vſe of theſe great things, that ſhould make one feare before God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the reuerence towards his Mageſtie, and griefe and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus much for taking Gods name in vaine by ſpeach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an oath. Now followes that taking of his name in vaine, which is with an oath: and this three waies, by ſwearing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vainely or wickedlie, or falſelie. Vaine ſwearing is, when one in his common and ordinarie talke, mingle words &amp; fils vp his ſentences with needeleſſe oathes, which though men account as a ſmall ſinne, yet it is a moſt notorious diſhonour of God, and proceeds from the diuell, hee is the father of it,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:59"/> as Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 5. <hi>Let your yea, bee yea, and your nay, nay, for whatſoeuer is aboue, comes from the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill one,</hi> j. <hi>the diuell.</hi> So that the roote of it is exceeding euill, and therefore the branch it ſelfe, is not any thing commendable, and then if you will know the fruit of it, S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſhewes it in his 2. chap. verſe. 11. <hi>Sweare not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my brethren, neither by heauen nor earth, nor any other oath, but let your yea bee yea, and your nay nay, leaſt you fall into condemnation.</hi> So that the diuell is the author of vaine oathes, damnation is the end and fruit of vaine oathes, &amp; hee that is willing to bee lead by ſuch a guide, and come to ſuch an end, hee may take his libertie to vſe them: but one may ſay, I doe not ſweare great oathes, as by God, and by the bloud and wounds of Chriſt, and ſuch fearefull oathes, but pettie and ſmall oathes, as by my faith and truth, by this bread, this fire, this light, &amp;c. and ſuch trifling things. But Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweares for this, that wee muſt not ſweare neither by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor the gold, nor heauen, nor earth, no not ſo much as by any haire, becauſe God is the author and maker of all things, and there appeares ſuch a Mageſtie and power of God in the ſimpleſt of his creatures, as no man can expreſſe, and muſt therefore reuerence them more, then ſo lightly to abuſe them. So that whether greater oathes or leſſer oathes, if they bee idle oathes, Gods words hath condemned them, and they ſhal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance bring damnation. I but I ſweare that which is true, it is not a lie: bee it ſo; that if it bee the verie truth, yet God hath not bound you onely not to take vp his name falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but alſo not to take it vp idly &amp; vainely: and againe, this ordinary ſwearing in ones common talke, will at length bring falſe ſwearing, it cannot bee auoided, but that hee which vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſweares vainely, ſhall now and then ſweare falſelie, for the often toſsing of Gods holy and ſacred name, or any of his creatures in ones mouth friuelouſly and careleſlie, doth beget at length ſuch a baſe opinion and account of theſe things, that they care not how they vſe them. Oh but ſaith one; I would not ſweare indeede, but they conſtrained mee, and vrged mee to it, for they would not truſt mee elſe: but if they will not,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29174:59"/> better they not truſt you, then God not ſaue; better vndergoe mans vnjuſt ſuſpicion, then Gods juſt damnation. And what is the cauſe that ſome mens credit is growen ſo weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it wil not ſtand vnleſſe it be vnderpropped by an oath, becauſe they haue ſo wounded their name, by lying dealing, &amp; by coſenage, as that men take all fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r falſehood that comes from them, but if one would deale juſtly and truely, and liue an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt life, hee ſhould not neede to vſe ſuch ſinnefull ſhifts to get men to truſt him; for there bee many of Gods people, that through gods mercie can ſay, they haue dealt ſo honeſtly and conſcionablie with men, and haue made ſuch due account of their promiſe, as now no man that knowes them will goe about to put them to their oath, their bare word ſhall end the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, ſo that if they would deale plainely and juſtly with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and let them ſee ſome truth in their words, they ſhould not need this idle kind of adjuration to the hurt of their ſoules; ſo that to ſweare when no oath is required, or accepted, nor cannot edifie but rather hurt, is greatly to bee condemned. But if vaine ſwearing bee a plant of the diuells ſetting, and will bring forth fruit for his ſtore, viz. damnation; then how much more horrible and odious, is that blaſpemous and furious, and outragious ſwearing of many men, that if they bee neuer ſo little offended, and their minde diſpleaſed, then they fall to diſgorge their filthie ſtomacke vpon the name of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſpue out all the venime they can vpon his moſt ſacred Mageſtie, without any feare or reuerence; if in their hunting their dogs agree not to their minde, they fall a curſing and ſwearing, as it were to eaſe their diſtempred ſtomacke, by ſhameleſſe and blaſphemous tearing and rending the name of God; if God croſſe them in their dice, which are deere to them, they will croſſe him in his glory, which is deere to him; if hee will make the dice runne againſt them, they will not put it vp ſo, but they will bee reuenged, their tongue ſhall run as faſt againſt him.</p>
               <p>Heere is an hart fully poſſeſſed with the diuell, or rather changed into a diuell, that can finde no other remedie vvhen
<pb facs="tcp:29174:60"/> they are croſt &amp; moued, but to diſhonour God, as who ſhould ſay, it is an eaſe &amp; pleaſure to their minde, when they can bring any foule diſgrace vnto his name, ſo much as in them lies. Hell gapes with open mouth for ſuch helliſh perſons, and a moſt horrible &amp; fearefull damnation remaines for ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fearefull ſinners. But this may be an vnſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to poore chriſtians, if God beare with ſuch perſons, with this furious mad beaſts, that bite at his name, and ſeeke to rend and teare his glory, how much more will he doe to them that loue him and reuerence him, and deſire to obey him; if God be ſo patient that for a while he wil ſuffer men as it were to ſpit in his face in a chafe, then thoſe that humbly caſt themſelues downe at his feet ſhall finde mercie. But let ſuch perſons, take heede how they preſume often thus to croſſe God in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in the thing that he moſt accounts of, for he wil not long ſit downe by it, he will not ſtill beare it, but he will ariſe in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and plague them in their ſoule, and in that that is neereſt vnto them, if they ſet their tongues againſt heauen, heauen will ſend downe thunderbolts of vengeance againſt them; &amp; if one daſh often againſt Chriſt, and will take no warning, at length Chriſt will fall vpon them and grinde them to pouder. And thus much for idle and fooliſh ſwearing, as alſo beaſtlike and outragious blaſpheming.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Gods name is taken in vaine by ſwearing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, that is, by ſwearing to doe euill, as <hi>Dauid</hi> in a paſsion, &amp; in an heate, ſware to kill <hi>Naball.</hi> Indeede <hi>Naball</hi> had deſerued death, and God did meet with him after, but <hi>Dauid</hi> had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to ſeeke ſo ſudden a reuenge, &amp; to ſweare to doe that too which as yet he had no calling. This kinde of ſwearing takes Gods name in vaine, which way ſo-euer one doe not keepe his oath, nor commit the euill he ſware too; yet he ſinned in that he made no greater reckoning of Gods name, but to take it vp lightly, and pawne it afore he had conſidered, whether he had lawfully ſo done or not; and if he doe keepe his wicked oath, that is moſt of all ſinfull, for then he makes God an author &amp; patrone, and calls him for a witneſſe and allower of his euill. So
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29174:60"/> that for one to ſweare he will be meet with ſuch an one that hath done him wrong, that he will be reuenged of him, or ſuch like, this is a grieuous profaning of Gods holy name, for Gods name ſhould feare vs from euill, not binde vs to euill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods name is exceedingly diſhonoured and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by ſwearing falſely, by forſwearing ones ſelfe, which is moſt vſually called perjurie. This is an horrible ſinne, tending to a moſt fearefull damnation; for if one ſhall giue account for euerie idle word, as Chriſt ſaith, and if one be ſubject to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for euerie vaine oath, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> affirmeth, then what ſhal be-come of thoſe, that will dare to call God to beare witneſſe of a falſe thing, and beare themſelues out in a lye, by pretending his name. Therfore in <hi>Zaccar.</hi> 5. the Lord ſhewes that his curſe like a fretting leproſie, ſhall come vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearer, and vpon his houſe, to conſume him and deuoure his poſteritie and ſubſtance, and ſhall eat into them, like a fretting leproſie, till it haue brought them to naught. And in the 15. Pſ. it is ſet as a note &amp; marke of a true chriſtian, that hauing ſworn to his hindrance, he will yet keepe his oath. Then how far is he from a good man that will of purpoſe ſweare that, which he neuer purpoſeth to performe, and ſet a better coulour vpon an vntruth by garding it with an oath. For it were better looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commoditie then of Gods fauour; and ſuffer damage in any thing, then in the matter of Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Now the circumſtances doe aggrauate this ſinne; It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wicked and curſed, if it be in a priuate place, and in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cauſe. But when one comes before a magiſtrate, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique aſſembly, and in a matter publikly knowne, and to be publikly tryed according to the truth and juſtice, then, to winne credit to a lye and vniuſt dealing, by calling the true God to vvitneſſe, and to behold is moſt notorious, and euen to lye againſt the holy ghoſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias.</hi> And this is to bring a many ſinnes into one; to be a theefe and rob the innocent, to peruert juſtice and trueth, and therefore when one comes to be a witneſſe before the face of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in judiciall manner, then purpoſely vppon ſet mallice,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:61"/> to ſhrowd and thruſt forward a lye, as it were vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſafeconduct of Gods moſt holy name, is one of the higheſt and ſoreſt breaches of this commandement, and abuſes of his name.</p>
               <p>Now the way to preſerue one againſt all theſe abuſes of Gods name, is to feare an oath, as in Eccleſiaſticus, ſetting a good man and oppoſing him to a ſinner, he giues him this marke, that he feares an oath, and if one be a frayde to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome his tongue to ſwearing, he ſhall not eaſily be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with wicked and much leſſe perjured ſwearing, but he that hath ſo lauiſh a tongue as it can with as much facilitie and nimbleneſſe poure foorth oathes as any other words, he is in continuall daunger to fall into that foule and moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hatefull ſinne of perjurie. And thus wee haue heard how this commandement is broken.</p>
               <p>Now where God forbids any ill, he commands the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary good. Therefore we muſt ſee what it commands. It commands generally to glorifie Gods name. As is ſhewed in the Table following.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, for life, a chriſtian is bound heere to behaue himſelfe ſo, that his whole conuerſation may bring glorie to the name of God. He muſt ſo profit in knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the word of God, which he profeſſeth, &amp; make ſuch a good proceeding in pure religion, as that he may beautifie his religion by a blameleſſe and vnſpotted behauiour. Thus in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine foorth, that men
<pb facs="tcp:29174:62"/> may ſee your good works, and glorifie your father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> He would haue chriſtians be as lights, and the light which they muſt ſend forth on euerie ſide muſt be a gratious, and chriſtian behauiour, that men ſeeing &amp; beholding theſe beams, may glorifie, not them, and commend them, for this a Phariſe will doe, ſeeke to haue men magnifie him, and ſpeake well of him; but a chriſtian muſt deſire that by his meanes men may be brought to magnifie the profeſsion of God, and to ſpeake and think moſt reuerently of that word, that hath wrought ſuch grace and ſuch reformation in them. The life muſt be the firſt beginner in religion, or elſe the ſpeach is but ridiculous; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to doe, to take my words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy mouth, and hateſt to be reformed;</hi> One goes beyond his calling and commiſsion, when he dare call himſelfe a chriſtian, and God his father, and will not yeld obedience vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in his practiſe. So 1. <hi>Peter. 2. 12. Haue your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation honeſt among the gentiles &amp;c. that they may glorifie God in the day of their viſitation. q. d.</hi> Therebe many of Gods elect that are as yet vnregenerate, and as bitter againſt Gods truth, as any of the reprobates, and will ſpeake as ill of profeſsion and profeſſours as any other, but God will viſit them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by his good ſpirit, and the ſunne of grace ſhall ſhine in their darke harts, to their enlightning; and Gods word ſhall work faith &amp; repentance in their harts, who when God hath ſhewed the ſame mercie to them that in former time he did to you, ſhall magnifie God for thoſe good things that haue bene in you, which haue cauſed them that bare an hard minde to religion afore, to loue and like it ſo much the more now. And though they ſtand out long, yet at length they ſhall be wonne, and then they will magnifie God. And euen bond men are commanded, notwithſtanding their low eſtate, &amp; the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their condition, yet, to bring ſome glory to God, and win ſome reuerence to their glorious profeſsion, by their good dealing. No man is in ſo meane a place, and ſo contemptible a degree but that he muſt if he will, take the name of Chriſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, &amp; the profeſsion of chriſtian religion, he muſt adorne,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29174:62"/> and deck it, which he may doe, by being faithfull and diligent in his place, and giuing euerie man his due conſcionably. Euen a ſeruant, if he be not audacious, and ſaucie, and malapart, and picking, and falſe, but truſtie and diligent, and ſeruiceable, and patient, and meeke, and humble, he keepes Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he glorifies God, he graces religion, he works out his owne ſaluation, doth what in him lyes, to conuert his vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing maſter, and ſhall haue a reward for this, as well as if he were in an higher and more honorable calling, that the world made more account off. Therefore this ſerues againe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute thoſe profeſſors, that are ſo ſlenderly ſeene in the meaning of Gods commandements, as that they think if they be not common ſwearers, and outragious blaſphemers, the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hath nothing to ſay them, &amp; they be free from the breach of it. But this and all other of Gods commandements are broken, as well by omiſsion, as commiſsion, as well by not performing that that is therein enjoyned, as by doing that that is forbidden, for God doth not giue a law altogether negatiue, but it conſiſts of a part affirmatiue to. And becauſe neglecting obedience to the firſt braunch of this holy commandement, &amp; care not to croſſe God in that that is neereſt vnto him, therfore he croſſeth &amp; plagueth them in that that they doe moſt ſet by.</p>
               <p>In the verie firſt petition Chriſt bids vs ſay, <hi>Hallowed</hi> or <hi>ſanctified be thy name.</hi> j. Let vs and all profeſſours, be ſo well grounded in the vnderſtanding of the word, and rooted in the good affection to the ſame, as that their life led in all good conſcience, may bring glorie to thy name, and religion. Now for one dayly to make this prayer, and neuer to regard his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how they be agreeable to his petition, and ſuch as in truth doe ſanctifie Gods name; what is that in deede, but to diſhonour him both in his life &amp; in his prayer. And thus much how ones life ſhould glorifie God.</p>
               <p>Now follows how he muſt glorifie him in word &amp; ſpeaches. Firſt in ſpeaking of Gods word, as one ought, for wee muſt not onely not ſpeake of it vainely, jeſtingly, or wreſtingly, but wee muſt looke that wee doe ſpeake of it, to thoſe good
<pb facs="tcp:29174:63"/> vſes, and with that good affection and reuerence that is meete. And ſo in Deutr. 6. 7. <hi>Theſe words ſhall bee in thine hart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is not left at ones diſcreation, whether hauing gods word in his hart hee will ſpeake it, but it is laid as a commandement with equall authoritie with the former, that hee ſhall talke of it: and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it bee within, it will bee heard without; as Pſal. 37. 30. 31. <hi>The mouth of the righteous will ſpeake of wiſedome, the law of God is in his hart, his feete ſhall not ſlide.</hi> Hee ſhewes the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a righteous man, that hee hath Gods law ſo rooted and ſetled in his hart, as it will ſprout and bud foorth in his mouth, and theſe doe ſo keepe and preſerue him, that either he ſhall not doe any thing that is wicked, or fall into ſinne, or if hee doe, hee ſhall bee ſoone and happily recouered: Thoſe therefore faile much in this dutie, that will neuer talke of any thing in the ſcripture, or of any part in gods word, they will come to the church, &amp; giue the preacher an houres hearing, but follow them out of the church dore, &amp; what kind of conference ſhal you heare come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them? not one word of the ſermon, but preſently of earth, earth, ſtraight to the rooting againe; though theſe men bee not common ſwearers, yet they haue broke this commandement, for God commands vs heere to ſpeake ſo wiſelie and diſcreetlie of his law, as others may reape fruit and himſelfe to. And therefore howſoeuer fooliſh perſons are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to excuſe themſelues that they bee not booke-learned, and therefore they cannot talke of ſcripture, but they haue a good hart, and if one could ſee into them, hee ſhould ſee wonders forſooth, and many great matters they haue in their hart, as this by the way muſt be marked for a general rule, that as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is more emptie of goodneſſe, ſo he is moſt full of brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and the moſt ignorant perſons be the greateſt boaſters, thoſe that neither know God nor themſelues, nor haue any ſparke of grace and repentance, of all others, theſe will make you the moſt floriſhing ſhew in words, what a good hart they haue, how good a faith, how they ſerue God day and night, and many excellent things, rare men they bee, if you will beleeue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29174:63"/> their owne report; for ſuch perſons I ſay, that haue all their goodneſſe lockt vp ſo that it can neuer come abroad, they may ſay what they will of themſelues, but Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>a good man out of the good treaſure of his hart, brings foorth good things.</hi> This is ſuch a treaſure as muſt needes be brought to light now and then, yea continually, for if one ſay, he hath a coffer full of good gold, and yet can fetch nothing out but counters, no man euer ſaw him bring an handfull of pure gold out of his cheſt, but euery day counters good ſtore, ſure by this that comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, one may quickly geſſe what ſtore is within, and few wiſe men will count him euer the richer for his golden words, when hee hath nothing but braſſe comes out of his purſe. And ſo in the Pro. the wiſe man ſaith, that <hi>the tongue of the righteous is a tree of life, and that it feedeth many.</hi> And therefore hee that can feede no man, how comes this to paſſe, ſurely hee is not a tree of life, hee wants grace. So that as a man muſt not ſpeake idly and peruertinglie of Gods word, ſo hee muſt not holde his peace neither, as if hee were dumbe, but hee muſt haue the law of grace vnder his lips, and ſpeake of it reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to edification, and hee that doth not ſo, breakes the third commandement.</p>
               <p>Secondly one muſt ſpeake of Gods titles &amp; properties, with feare and with an holie trembling, to the benefit of men and the praiſe of God by them. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 40. Pſal. 9. ſaith of him ſelfe, <hi>I haue declared thy righteouſneſſe in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, I haue not hid thy righteouſneſſe, and I conſealed not thy mercie and thy truth &amp;c.</hi> Theſe were the things whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> would ſpeake of, the great mercie of God, and of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſtable truth, that men might learne hence, to flie vnto him, and depend vpon him in their miſeries. And hee ſhould ſhew forth his righteouſneſſe, that men ſhould know that it would ſurelie goe well with the righteous, and that the wicked ſhould haue according to the worke of his hands, for God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe itſelfe, muſt needs puniſh the one and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the other, as their life and deeds had deſerued. Theſe were the things about which he would willinglie exerciſe his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:64"/> tongue, &amp; ſpeake joyfullie to the people, for one cannot ſpeak of theſe things conſcionablie, but it will work in him a feeling and a loue of theſe things, ſo that him ſelfe ſhall get more good and thoſe alſo that heare him. So the 107. Pſal. 8. <hi>Let them conſider before the Lord his louing kindneſſe, and his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes before the ſonnes of men.</hi> He would haue vs haue ſuch a feeling in our hands, as that we ſhould not onelie confeſſe Gods kindneſſe to him, but before men alſo make the ſame knowne. And therfore all of vs muſt here bee humbled and acknowledge how exceeding ſhort we come, how ſeldome or neuer we breake forth into ſuch confeſsion or declaration of Gods power, wiſdome, mercie, &amp; ſuch like good, as our ſelues and others might therby be ſtired vp the more, to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him, and to ſtay vpon him: Who almoſt hath ſaid as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſal. <hi>Come and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for me, what carefulneſſe he hath had ouer our ſoules and bodies, what faithfulneſſe he ſhewed vnto vs in all our needs, and of all his wonderfull mercie and wiſdome, whereof we may ſee experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Manie can make long diſcourſes, of the kindneſſe of ſuch a friend, and ſpend an houre together, what this and that good man hath done for him, but for God that giues life and breath and all thinges, and that giues power to our friends to doe vs good, and kindneſſe to put that power in practiſe, who doth almoſt ſpeake of all his goodneſſe, of all his power that hee continually doth ſhew &amp; practiſe towards vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to moue himſelfe and others the more earneſtlie to glorifie his name. Likewiſe thirdlie we are here commanded, to ſpeake of Gods workes, with reuerence &amp; thanks giuing, wether the workes of mercie or of iuſtice. And thus the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> with there leader <hi>Moyſes</hi> after that wonderfull deliuerance at the red ſea, did fall to praiſing and magnifieng God, and to confeſſe his excellent greatneſſe and mageſtie, and ſet out the ſame to all poſterities. And as one muſt magnifie God for all his workes, ſo eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thoſe that goe moſt beyond the reach, and ſeeme moſt contrary to carnall reaſon: and thus <hi>Paul</hi> hauing diſputed of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29174:64"/> election and reprobation, ſuch works as carnall men and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wit moſt ſnuffes at, and would willingly ſnarle and ſpeake moſt vildly of it, if it durſt for feare of men; he being a man of Gods, ſpeaks moſt reuerently, and with wonderfull awe of the greatneſſe of God. Rom. 11. 33. <hi>O the deepeneſſe of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God, how vnſearchable are his Iudgements, and his waies paſt finding out, and then who hath knowne the minde of the Lord.</hi> j. who can tell why God choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth one to life, and refuſeth an other to death, why he will haue one ſaued and an other condemned, who can aſsigne the cauſe of theſe hidden things. And in the next verſe hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken off, ordaining one to ſhame, and an other to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; he ſhuts vp &amp; cloſes all with this holy &amp; reuerent conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wondring at his greatneſſe, <hi>of him,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>and to him, &amp; for him are all things, to him bee glory for euer, Amen. q. d.</hi> hee made all things at the firſt himſelfe, he ſuſtaines and preſerues all things by his owne power, ſtill; therefore it is moſt juſt and equall, that he ſhould diſpoſe and order all things according as ſeemes beſt to him, for his owne glorie. And as we muſt ſtriue to magnifie God in theſe works, that croſſe our reaſon, ſo in thoſe alſo that are moſt contrarie to our affection, as in our croſſes and afflictions. And thus did <hi>Iob,</hi> when God had taken away his ſonnes, his ſeruants, his ſheepe, his Oxen, his Camels, and all his goods, and that all of the ſuddaine, he falls not to murmur and grudge againſt God, but breakes out into the praiſe of God, <hi>The Lord hath giuen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> In all theſe miſeries hee could finde in his hart and finde good cauſe to bleſſe the name of God, for he knew that it came from God, and though the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel were a chiefe ſtirrer, yet he could not goe beyond his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion; and though God had taken away all, no wrong was done to <hi>Iob,</hi> Gods it was, and God had giuen it him, and might haue taken it away ſooner, and therefore ſtill he was to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo did <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him doe what he will,</hi> ſo that euen in gods chaſtiſements &amp; corrections which are tedious to the fleſh, and goe againſt the graine of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:65"/> we muſt prayſe him. As <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in the end of his ſeuen yeares miſerie, ſaith, <hi>He is holy in all his works, and Iuſt in all his wayes.</hi> And thus we muſt glorifie the name of God in ſpeach, without an oath.</p>
               <p>Now it followes to be ſpoken of an oath: and firſt, we muſt know that it is a dutie &amp; ſeruice of God when we haue a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling &amp; juſt warrant to take an oath, ſo it be done aright, as raſh ſwearing is a ſinnefull thing, ſo reuerent ſwearing is an holy thing, and one may ſinne as well in omitting this when it is lawfully required, as in committing the other which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. So Deut. 6. 13. and 10. 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord, and ſerue him and ſweare in his name.</hi> In both which places god plainely commands it, as a ſeruice of him to ſweare by him, when one hath a warrantable and juſt cauſe to take an oath. Therefore their error muſt bee condemned, that would alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether root out the vſe of oathes as vnlawfull, and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereto refuſe it, becauſe they ſay they would not take gods name in vaine; nay, now they doe take Gods name in vaine, in refuſing to ſweare by it reuerently, and vpon good ground &amp; allowance, they might euen as well refuſe to heare, and reade, and pray, as to ſweare, being thus called therevnto. Likewiſe it ſerues for our inſtruction, that when the caſe ſtands ſo, as that an oath is required at our hands, by thoſe which haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and when wee haue a ſufficient warrant, then wee ſhould willingly and cheerefully doe it, and that with a minde to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and an expectation of a bleſsing vpon this, as vpon hearing and reading, becauſe it is an ordinance of God, as well as they bee: and it is a fault, when men comming to this, doe not propoſe the glory of God vnto themſelues, or looke for any reward for this dutie, but onely looke to the ciuill ends, to ſet agreement, and make all things right, and ſuch like, not thinking that this is a matter of highlie honouring God, nor looking to his name, nor to his promiſe of giuen good ſucceſſe and bleſsing to all his ordinances. Manie will hope to ſpeede better, for a good prayer, as in deede they ſhall, which neuer hope that god will looke any whit, the more fauourablie vpon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29174:65"/> them, for a lawfull and a juſt oath, but if God will puniſh vaine ſwearers, he will reward good ſwearing, and thoſe that vſe it aright, as a curſe is denounced againſt the fooliſh and idle abuſing of it, ſo the reuerent and conſcionable vſe of it, muſt haue a promiſe of bleſsing annexed to it alſo. But for want of knowledge and faith in this point, we want the fruit of it, wheras a chriſtian ſwearing for conſcience ſake, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods commandement may lay vpon an oath among his beſt ſeruices, and accounts, and treaſure it vp as a precious jewell that ſhall bring an excellent reward with it; for God wil not forget thoſe that ſanctifie his name, and one cannot doe that more then in an holy and reuerent ſwearing by it. Now that one may ſweare lawfully, theſe rules muſt be obſerued, both for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>the perſons &amp; either thing making or taking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOr the perſon making, this muſt be knowne &amp; obſerued, that he muſt bee a chriſtian, for no vnregenerate man can ſweare lawfullie. And therfore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſwearing ſaith, I call God to witneſſe, why but ſo may an vnregenerate man, and his oath be worth nothing, therfore hee ads, whome I ſerue in my ſpirit, ſhewing that he that will comfortablie take the name of god in his mouth to ſweare, muſt ſanctifie him in his hart, and ſerue him in his ſpirit, or elſe hee doth take the name of God in vaine, he doth not gloriſie him at all, for an ill tree ſaith Chriſt, cannot bring forth good fruit, and though others may haue good by that which he ſhall doe, yet it can bring no good or comfort to himſelfe; nay it is an ill work in him, as the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and caſting out diuells, and other works which he through chriſts commiſsion was able to doe, were wicked things in him, and ſo farre from doing good to him, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him any comfort in time of his afflicted conſcience, that they rather were torments, and as hell fire in his boſome to vex and terrifie him, that had made ſo faire a ſhew, when in trueth he had ſo ſoule an hart. So if an vnregenerate man take an oath, though it be moſt true, yet he ſinnes and diſhonours God
<pb facs="tcp:29174:66"/> in thus ſwearing, becauſe whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, now he hath no faith, nor neuer lookes to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or glorie in his oath; therefore the man muſt be good, ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, and by faith, able to looke to the commandement &amp; promiſe, being truely conuerted vnto God. Therefore whoſoeuer hath taken an oath before his calling, how euer in it ſelfe lawfull, yet he muſt be humbled for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, becauſe it was a ſinne in him, being voide of faith, &amp; wanting a good conſcience, and all true reuerence of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtie, for theſe things can neuer be wrought, but by the work of Gods ſpirit, conuerting and regenerating, therefore in time of ones vnregeneracie, he tooke Gods name in his mouth, when there was no feare of him in his hart, and to the impure all things are impure. This muſt be obſerued in the maker. Now in him that takes an oath, this is requiſite, without which an oath cannot be lawfull, that he require it and be willing to accept it, for if the partie vnto whome one ſweares, doe not deſire nor will not receiue an oath, then the oath is a wicked oath, and therefore many men are to be reproued, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon buying and ſelling, are ſo readie to ſweare, as that though no man be willing, they ſhould ſweare, ye, rather is grieued and troubled at it, yet euerie thing of neuer ſo light moment, muſt haue the confirmation of an oath joyned vnto it. But what get they that will make a trade of ſwearing? ſurely this, that they grow to be ſuſpected of vnfaithfulneſſe, and when they be ſo lauiſh of Gods name, both their owne harts grow leſſe to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it, and others will not beleeue them, but the more ſuſpect them, the more they think to remoue all ſuſpicion; for a godly man and one that hath any true fidelitie in him, ſets more by the name of God, then to pawne it vpon euerie ſmal occaſion, and therfore thoſe may be juſtly thought moſt deceitfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, that be moſt prophane to God, and he that cares not to diſhonour God, will neuer make any great bones of couſening his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Theſe rules are for the perſons. Now for the thing it ſelfe. Firſt it muſt be true that is ſworne, that is, the thing which we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29174:66"/> confirme by taking the name of God in our mouthes, muſt not onely be true in it ſelfe, but it muſt alſo be a knowne trueth, of which he that ſweares hath ſome certaintie, his conſcience muſt not doubt of the trueth of it, if he doe, he ſets to light by Gods name. So <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4. 2. He requires that one muſt ſweare in truth and in judgement; if one will come to auer and affirme a thing with an oath, he muſt be able to ſay I ſweare nothing but that which vpon ſound ground &amp; good proofe I know to be true, I am ſure of it, and haue in mine owne hart, juſt warrant for that which I ſpeake, elſe if one will come vpon euery light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and ſlender opinion, to binde a thing by the name of God, though it fall out to be ſo, yet he hath profaned Gods name, and taken it vp with a vaine and vnreuerent affection, in that he is ſo raſh as to venture ſo eaſily and ſuddenly vpon ſo great and waightie a thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an oath muſt not be tendred in light and ſmall matters, but in things of moment and importance, though the matter be true and in our knowledge, ſuch as we may ſafely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the trueth of it; yet if it be but a trifle, and ſuch a thing as if we be not credited, it is not worth an oath, in ſuch caſe a man muſt rather be content not to be credited, then to call Gods name to witneſſe. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was the judge, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed inferiour officers to be conuerſant in ſmaller matters, and onely the greater and waightier cauſes were brought to him to heare and decide; now then, if it were not fit for <hi>Moſes</hi> to be called to the ending and making vp of euerie light and idle controuerſie, much leſſe is it fit for vs to debaſe GOD ſo much as to bring him in vpon euerie trifle. We would count it a verie vnmannerly thing, if one ſhould goe to the Lord chiefe juſtice or ſome high officer about a ſheafe of corne or cock of hay, and no man could ſerue his turne, but ſome great officer in high place, to haue the hearing of theſe toyes, and if it be to much diſgracing of a noble mans dignitie to call him foorth about euery ſuch thing of no waight, much more profaneneſſe is it towards God, and ſhewes an hart nothing touched with the greatneſſe of his mageſtie, to vrge him to come out of his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:67"/> place, and be a witneſſe to ſuch matters. Therefore vnleſſe it bee matter of waight that tends to ſome glory of GOD, or ſome great good of man, to ende ſome contention that would be dangerous, and to ſet vnitie and good order amongſt men, we muſt not be bold to meddle with the name of God, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to call him as a witneſſe of the thing in hand.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, one muſt doe it with great feare and reuerence, as in Eccleſ. It is noted as the mark of a good man, to feare an oath: and though one be the child of God, and an oath be required of him, and hee know the thing to bee certainely true, and the matter alſo of waight worth an oath, yet if hee come lightlie without any regard of God, and reuerence of that excellent name, hee is to take in his mouth, hee hath failed in his ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and hath taken Gods name in vaine, and is to bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it. For in the Pſal. he ſaith, <hi>Serue the Lord with feare.</hi> Now if a man muſt not vndertake any ſeruice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare and reuerence, much leſſe muſt hee call God to bee a ſpeciall witneſſe, and after a ſpeciall manner ſet himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him without trembling, and a ſpeciall awe of his Mageſtie. And thus much for the commandement; now follows the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that takes his name in vaine.</head>
                  <p>HEere God from the greatneſſe of the perill, goes about to terrifie men from the ſin: now where hee ſaith, <hi>I will not holde him guiltleſſe,</hi> ſomething more is expreſſed, then is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, for the meaning is, that God will account him as guiltie, and execute a ſharp and ſeuere puniſhment vpon him. So that this wee may obſerue as a plaine doctrine out of this doctrine, that hee which ſinnes againſt this commandement, vnleſſe hee doe ſoundly repent, ſhall feele Gods hand heauie vpon him, God will neuer put it vp, but will bee throughly reuenged vpon him for it. Of all ſinnes this ſeemes moſt ſafe in the eies of men, a greater penaltie is laide vpon him that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29174:67"/> robs a man of his goods, then vpon him that robs God of his glorie, and one may with more eaſe carrie out a blaſpemous &amp; furious oath, yea many of them, &amp; wicked ſcoffing &amp; mocking of his word &amp; works, then any ſlanderous reproch or taunting terme againſt his neighbour, that is but duſt and aſhes like himſelfe. Therefore ſith men let it ſlip ſo eaſily, God will take the more notice of it, and puniſh it more ſharplie: for indeede men are more carefull farre of their owne vaineglory, then of Gods glory, and therefore if God ſhould refer it to mens aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it is ſure, little order would bee taken for it; yea commonlie it is ſeene that thoſe which ſhould reforme and correct others, in this point haue themſelues moſt neede to bee reformed and corrected, &amp; the greateſt rulers that ſhould moſt repreſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, of all others practiſe it moſt; for if they bee neuer ſo little croſſed, how doe they ſeeke to eaſe themſelues, but by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and outragious ſwearing. Therefore if God ſhould put ouer the puniſhment of it, to their diſcreation, like inough a very ſlight penaltie ſhould ſerue the turne: and men alſo could not inflict a ſufficient puniſhment, anſwerable to the fault, for damnation is the due puniſhment, as in <hi>Iames</hi> 5. Therfore God will haue it come before his judgement ſeat, and himſelfe will be the judge, and the executioner in this offence. Sith then god vndertakes to puniſh it? the vſe of it is for the tenor &amp; affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all vngodly perſons, that take libertie to themſelues, to run euer in the breach of this commandement aboue the reſt, that they grow ſhameleſſe, they neuer ſeeke to hide it, nay they will doe it to anger one, and they take a pride in it to; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo of the ciuiller ſort, will be loath a man ſhould ſee them take away their neighbours ſheepe, or prig a ſheet from off the hedge, but if they ſweare in a paſsion, come and tell them that they are in great fault, they wrong God, in that which is moſt deare vnto him, they prophane and diſhonour his name, then they turne all into a jeſt and laughing; what, is that ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe you ſtand ſo much vpon an oath, why who is there I wonder, that doth not ſweare ſometimes, and drop out an oath now and then, afore hee be aware, when he is angrie? and doe
<pb facs="tcp:29174:68"/> they make ſo light a matter of it, is it a ſmall thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of God? nay there bee ſome of Gods people that can ſay, truely through Gods mercie, they had rather chooſe to haue their ſoule drop from their bodie, then an vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and paſsionate oath from their mouth, for if God haue threatned to bring damnation vpon light ſwearers, then where ſhall mad and franticke ſwearers appeare, theſe bitter ſwearers, how great a damnation muſt they looke for? vnleſſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be exceeding great, for though men let them paſſe, yet before the great judge of heauen, they be liable to an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternall death; wherefore in a caſe of ſuch danger, men muſt bee content to bee admoniſhed, and to bee helped out of the ſinne, and not take one and chafe at him, that by an whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rebuke deſires to draw their ſoules out of hell, which they would not doe, if they did beleeue that God would ſo ſeuerely puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this may ſerue for the comfort of thoſe that haue receiued wrong by falſe oathes, and haue falſe matters carried out againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the help of perjurie; though corrupt iudges for their owne gaine ſometimes regard not this, but looke ſlightly ouer, &amp; it goes for currant, yet the judge of judges will make a better inquirie, &amp; come with a more true verdit, &amp; will lay open their innocencie, and the damnable hipocriſie and impudencie of their aduerſaries, and not onely diſcouer it, but plague and confound them for it, if they perſiſt impenitent: and this was the caſe <hi>Naboth</hi> and his children, they were by ſuch wretched dealing, ſurpriſed and brought to death, as male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, as traitors againſt the King, and blaſphemers of God, but hath not God in his word ſhewed how hee brought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction vpon the actors, and rooted them out, and ſwept them and their ſeede away like doung from the face of the earth, &amp; <hi>Naboths</hi> name is now cleered, and euery one that heares of him knowes him to haue beene better then <hi>Ahab</hi> or <hi>Ieſabel</hi> were: ſo that God brought their ſinne vpon their heads, and hath not ſuffered his innocencie to bee ſtained; God would not beare with it, how euer <hi>Ahab</hi> being the king, no man durſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29174:68"/> goe about to redreſſe it. Therefore all be it ſometimes wicked ſinners, will impudently outface, and by ſwearing and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ouer-ſway the good cauſes of Gods children, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way matters for a time, that are altogether falſe: yet be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, God will not let the vprightneſſe of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; he will not ſuffer that his ſacred name ſhal be thus wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, to be made a ſhelter for lies and ſlaunders, but when the good time comes, he will let the world ſee how vildly and ſhamefully they dealt, and though now whilſt God holdeth his peace, they flatter themſelues and care not a jot to prophane his name, ſo they may effect their malicious purpoſe, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters goe on their ſide, yet God will haue a care that their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe ſhall returne and fall vpon their owne heads, &amp; their owne ſhame ſhall couer their faces, and the wrong done both to his name and to his ſeruants ſhalbe fully diſcouered and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged. Thus much concerning the third commandement, for the glorifieng of Gods name. Now followes the fourth, In theſe words following.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſumme of this fourth commandement is, to command the ſetting a part of the ſeauenth day, from all worldlie buſines, and affaires, to the exerciſes of religion and mercie, and in the night that our ſleepe alſo be ſeaſoned with the word, and the exerciſe of which we haue bene pertakers. The parts are two. The one ſets downe the duties to be performed, the other the reaſons to moue vs to performe them. The duties two fold, ſhewing what we ſhould doe, and from what we ſhould decline. The things to be done, is keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:29174:69"/> it holie, celebrating an holie reſt vnto God. The things to be forborne, are all body lie works, and to ſee that thoſe which be vnder our gouernment, as children, ſeruants, and all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours doe the like, and that our beaſts be not put to any ciuill labour, yea that the ſtranger, when hee comes amongſt vs, doe not openly prophane the ſame, though wee cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to come to the publik exerciſes, yet thoſe that are in ſuperioritie, muſt reſtraine him from publik violating of it, by open working, and muſt lay the authoritie ſo farre vpon him, as that they ſuffer him not among their people, and in their juriſdiction, in the face of the congregation, openlie to breake the commandement of God. The reaſons are diuerſe, firſt drawne from the equitie and righteouſneſſe of it in theſe words, <hi>ſixe daies ſhalt thou labour q. d.</hi> I haue giuen thee ſix daies for thy buſineſſe, and haue taken but one for my ſelfe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt be verie well contented, to yeeld to me in this ſo reaſonable and equall a commandement. If I had taken ſixe to my ſeruice &amp; giuen thee but one for the works of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet thou ſhouldeſt in dutie haue obeyed me, but now that I am ſo liberall to thee, and ſcant to my ſelfe, hauing ſo large allowance, there is no reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt refuſe. The ſecond reaſon, is taken from the authoritie and right of God, in theſe words, <hi>The ſeauenth day is the ſabboth of the Lord thy God, q. d.</hi> I haue taken it to my ſelfe, I haue challenged it to my ſelfe, to bee imployed in my ſeruice, it is my day not thine, therfore, vnleſſe thou will bee accounted a ſacrilegious theefe, to take holie things for vnholie vſes, vnleſſe thou wilt deuoue things that bee ſanctified to thine owne deſtruction, ſee that thou meddle not with it, it is a part of the church treaſurie, &amp; thou ſhalt be no better then a church robber, if thou conuert it to thine owne vſes. The third reaſon is taken from Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in theſe words. <hi>For in ſixe daies the Lord made heauen &amp; earth the ſea and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeauenth daie, q. d.</hi> if thou wilt follow example and bee led by others, then follow the example of the beſt; now what better example can there be, then the example of God himſelfe; now God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when he went to make the world, and all the things in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29174:69"/> world, contriued all his works ſo, as that he finiſhed them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of ſixe dayes, and on the ſeuenth day did reſt from all his works of creation, onely preſeruing thoſe things which before he had made, therefore from his example learne thou ſo to diſpatch all thy buſineſſe on the ſixe daies, as that on the ſeauenth day ceaſing from labour in thy calling, thou maiſt wholy giue thy ſelfe to the duties of ſanctification, and to meditate on Gods power and greatneſſe, in his ſixe dayes work, for which end, as one ſpeciall thing to bee done in it, he hath appointed this reſting of the ſeuenth day. The laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is taken from the end of the ſabboth, in theſe words, <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord bleſſed the ſabboth day and hallowed it. q. d.</hi> If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the equitie of the commandement, nor the authoritie and right of God, nor yet his example will preuaile with thee to perſwade thine hart to keepe this commandement, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thine owne profit, and the benefit thou ſhalt reape to thy ſelfe, yeld to keepe it holy, for God hath not taken this to himſelfe for any commoditie that he ſhall haue by it, but euen for thy good, for he hath appointed it for holy vſes, that it might be a meanes of bleſsing not vpon the ſoule onely, but euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the body and eſtate of thoſe that obſerue it; there is no readier way to bring Gods bleſsing vpon any man then the ſanctifying of it, nor no more preſent meanes to pull downe a curſe, then the neglecting and breaking of it. Therefore if thou loue thy ſelfe and wouldeſt haue proſperitie on thy ſoule and bodie, yeld ſo much obedience to God, as to ſanctifie his ſabboth. Thus much concerning the ſumme and expoſition of this commandement. Now becauſe there be many that doe diſagree in this doctrine of the ſabboth, and account the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping holy of the ſeuenth day in the number of thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which be abrogated by Chriſt, and reached onely to the Iewes, therefore it is requiſite that we approue and confirme by ſome ſound reaſons out of Gods word, that this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is morall and perpetuall, and as carefully to be kept vnder the goſple, as vnder the law, and to continue in force, ſo long as any of the commandements, euen ſo long as there is
<pb facs="tcp:29174:70"/> this world, and a Church militant vpon earth. The firſt reaſon to confirme this, may be drawne from thoſe reaſons which God vſeth for the confirmation of it, in the text; the reaſons are all of them perpetuall, and none of them ceremoniall, and euery one as much belongs vnto vs, as vnto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is without reaſon, to make the commandement it ſelfe of leſſe ſcope, and binding fewer to keepe it, then thoſe reaſons which are brought to confirme it. For goe through the whole commandement, what one word in all of it, hath any note of ceremony, what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſauours of any ſpecial thing to the Iewes, that the commandement ſhould be tyed onely to them; for god commands them to keep the ſeuenth, becauſe it is moſt equal, being that he hath permitted ſixe dayes for their buſineſſe. Why, and hath he not giuen vs libertie to labour ſixe dayes in our calling, and is not the equitie altogether as forceable to vs in euery age, as it was to them, in their ages. If God haue taken from vs none of the ſixe daies which he gaue to them, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue we to take away more of the ſeuenth, or any of the ſeuenth more, then they. Then ſecondly, it is the Lords, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iewes may not dare to imploy it, any other wayes then according to his will, and doth not this reaſon hold as ſtrongly now, haue we any priuiledge graunted, to lay theeuiſh hands, vpon thoſe holy things which are Gods, more then in old time the Iewes had; &amp; for the example of God, that he ceaſed from creating, doth it not reach to all ages a like; are not we as much bound to follow Gods example as euer any. Laſtly it is a day bleſſed to them that keepe it, and to this ende conſecrated, that it may bring a bleſsing; hath time worne out the force of this argument, is God leſſe able to bleſſe vs, or ſhould we leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or doe we leſſe ſtand in need of his bleſsing, then they? We ſee then that all the reaſons are firme and ſtrong, the length of time cannot abrogate the truth and ſtrength of the reaſons; therefore neither can it diſanul the commandement. For where God giues a ceremoniall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, which he would haue the Iewes onely to obſerue, there he frames his reaſon thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from ſome thing that ſpecially toucheth the Iewes, &amp; hath
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29174:70"/> no ſuch affinitie and agreement to other nations, as for the paſſeouer, he commands the Iewes to keepe that, why, becauſe the Angell paſſed ouer their houſes, when he deſtroyed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians, and they muſt giue the firſt borne to God; why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not ſmite their firſt borne, in the ſlaughter of the Egiptians, and ſo many other ceremonies, haue reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto them, which being peculiar to the Iewes, ſhewed that they did onely binde the Iewes vnder the law; but of all the reaſons heere alleadged, we ſee that none is ceremoniall, peculiar or proper to the Iewes, but euery one common to all, and as large as all the world; therefore thoſe that cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themſelues from the arguments confirming the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, may not pull their necks out of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, from the time when this commandement was firſt giuen, and the keeping holy of a ſabboth day inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we may eaſily perceiue, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is no more ceremoniall then all the reſt. For it was giuen in mans inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, when <hi>Adam</hi> was perfect and needed no ceremonie to leade him to Chriſt, becauſe he did not neede to beleeue in Chriſt, being himſelfe perfect, and holding his happie eſtate, not by faith in Chriſt, but by faith in Gods word, and his owne obedience vnto Gods word. For this commandement was not firſt made at Mount Sinah, no more then any of the other 10. but equally with them bound the conſcience of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man, and is of like antiquitie. The firſt ſeuenth day that euer was, was as much to be ſanctified as any that followed, as may appeare in the ſecond of Gen. laſt verſe, where it is ſaid, that God after the creation in the ſixe dayes, reſted from cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the ſeuenth, and therefore he hallowed the ſeuenth day, and bleſſed it. Now then, ſith it was firſt inſtituted in Paradice, afore there either was a ceremonie, or neede of a ceremonie; it may not be reputed among the Iewiſh ceremonies. And this reaſon is to be noted, becauſe it ſhewes the fooliſhneſſe of that friuolous reaſon, which ſome men bring againſt the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day. Oh ſay the Iewes they were children in Chriſt, and weaklings, and therefore they had neede of a ſabboth; But we
<pb facs="tcp:29174:71"/> are paſt babes, we are men growne &amp; haue more knowledge, we are ſtronger then they; Are you ſtronger then the Iewes? be it. Though if it were tryed, many of theſe that brag of their ſtrength aboue the Iewes, would be found inferiour to many of the Iewes. But be it for the time, graunt them this, yet are they ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie; haue they greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and more grace then he had beefore his fall? Why, but God ſaw it needfull for <hi>Adam</hi> to haue a ſabboth, and if it were needfull that was without ſinne himſelfe, had no clog of corruption to hinder him, no ſinner to infect, no ill example to ſeduce, yet I ſay, if he had neede of this as God in his wiſdom judgeth, becauſe his calling, though followed without tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, would yet partly, haue withdrawne his hart, that he could not ſo freely &amp; wholy haue giuen himſelfe to praiſing of God, and conſidering of his power &amp; wiſdome, and mercie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to ſet one day apart from all works of his calling, to imploy it wholy in prayſing and magnifying God, and ſuch like duties, that he might with greater libertie &amp; comfort, doe them; then what neede haue we, and how far is our neceſsitie greater, which are burdened with many corruptions of our owne, and haue much temptation from many ill preſidents, &amp; many allurements of the world, to pull our harts from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which are men of polluted lips, our ſelues, and diuells amongſt people of polluted lips, &amp; which cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out far greater diſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wearineſſe alſo, follow our callings.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had neede of a ſabboth, when hee had no let with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nor without, how much haue we, that both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are beſet, and one euery ſide compaſſed with ſuch ſtrong impediments, from our ſelues and from others, that when wee haue a ſabboth to beſtow wholy and onely on Godlineſſe and religion, can yet hardly, and with much adoe keepe our harts from wandring after the world and earthly things. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt fond is this objection, if <hi>Adams</hi> ſtrength muſt bee helped by a ſabboth, then no man in this world hath ſo much ſtrength, as that hee for that cauſe may exempt himſelfe from keeping a ſabboth: it was giuen to ſtrengthen and help the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29174:71"/> Iewes, and they needed it, and it is giuen to vs to make vs ſtronger, yea it was giuen to <hi>Adam,</hi> and hee needed it, that hee might more freely ſerue God, and more comfortablie rejoyce in him; and for this reaſon alſo is perpetuall and no ceremonie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the manner of deliuerie confirmes the perpetuitie of it, &amp; ſhewes that it is ſtill of as great force as any of the reſt; for this was written by the finger of God in the table of ſtone, with the other to ſhew the durable continuance of the ſame, and therefore this is not exempted, Deut. 40. 4. That reaſon which <hi>Moyſes</hi> brings to confirme the authoritie of all, is not taken from this, that God firſt ſpake it with the reſt, &amp; after wrote it alſo in tables of ſtone. God did giue the ceremoniall law by <hi>Moyſes</hi> hand, and vſed him as an inſtrument to write them, but for the greater reuerence of theſe ten, hee would not vſe the help of <hi>Moyſes</hi> hand and pen, but with his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wrote them, not in paper with inke, but in ſtone to ſhevv the ſtrength and continuance of them, and commanded <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to put them in the arke to ſhew that no man could fulfill &amp; perfectly obey them but onely Chriſt: If theſe ten were all written by God, and no exception made, whereby the ſabboth ſhould bee inferiour to the reſt, but altogether put into the Arke, then a man may euen as well rend any of the other ten away as this, yea and with more warrant to, for none of them all is more fenced with reaſons, and mounded about with more ſtrong arguments to keepe out the cauils and objections of men then this, ſo that where God hath as it were of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, giuen more ſtrength, for a man to impute more weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to this thing, is a note either of great folly, or elſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular impudencie and impietie.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon is drawen from the perſons vpon whom it lieth, and vnto whom it is giuen: for wee know that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies did lie onely vpon the Iewes, the Gentiles were not bound to obſerue them: but now this commandement ſayth not onely thou, thy ſonne, thy daughter, thy man, thy maide, which containes all the whole commonwealth, but it goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; ſaith, thy ſtranger which is within thy gates: ſo that if an
<pb facs="tcp:29174:72"/> heathen man of another countrie and religion, had come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, the magiſtrate was bound to looke to it, that he doe not openly and publikely violate the ſabboth, but of force ſhould celebrate an outward, though to perform duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that lay not in mans hand to conſtraine them. Now the ceremonies were as a partition wall betwixt the Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to ſeperate the church of the Iewes, and the ſeede of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> from all other congregations, vntill after this partition was broken downe by Chriſt, and both brought into one fold, for when Chriſts death did teare aſunder the vale of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then hee tare all ceremonies in twaine, that they could no longer binde the conſcience either of Iew or Gentill: but for the ſabboth euen the Gentils muſt keepe it, and becauſe they would not themſelues, when they came among the ſeruants of God, they were to be conſtrayned; as in <hi>Nehemias</hi> time, when the men of Tyrus came to ſell wares on the ſabboth day, in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> hee would not ſuffer them, but threatens to lay hands vpon them, if they did any more come after that manner. If God had heere commanded onely to looke to the Iewes, and not to ſtrangers, it had beene ſome appearance, but ſith God will haue ſtrangers of the Gentils bound to the keeping of it, ſo farre as men can, if they come within the walke and reach of Chriſtians, now the matter is put quite out of doubt that this is no ceremonie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe the Lord of the Sabboth, confirmes the ſabboth moſt ſtrongly. Mat. 24. 20. Where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the deſtruction of Ieruſalem by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian,</hi> and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the faithfull of the church and true Chriſtians, whoſe prayers ſhall ſurely preuaile, he bids them pray that their flight bee not vpon the ſabboth day, or in the winter. Fortie yeeres after a fearefull deſtruction was to come vpon Ieruſalem, and this was decreed ſo that it might not bee altered, yet Chriſt bids his ſeruants pray, that it might bee mittigated to them in ſome meaſure, and therefore that they might not bee enforced to flie for their liues in the winter, for that would bee grieuous to the bodie, becauſe of the ſhortneſſe of the daies, and the dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29174:72"/> of the waies would bee very tedious to them, nor vpon the ſabboth, becauſe this would bee as grieuous to their ſoules, if they muſt bee conſtrained to ſpend that day in taking paines to preſerue their bodies, which God had appointed to be ſpent in thoſe things that ſhould help forward the ſaluation of their ſoules. What, will ſome ſay, is it not lawfull to flye for ones lyfe on the ſabboth? yes: and Chriſt allowes it. But he knew full well what griefe it would bring to a chriſtian ſoule, to think, Alaſſe I was wont as this day to ſit quietly in the church and among Gods Saints to heare the ſweet comforts of his word deliuered vnto my ſoule, and with praiſe to ſing Pſalmes of thanks vnto God, and to aske thoſe things with the reſt of Gods people which we ſtoode in neede of, where I receaued ſuch ſtrength &amp; comfort, that I walked in the ſtrength of theſe exerciſes the whole weeke after, but now the paine of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the feare of my ſoule ſo diſtract me, &amp; take me vp that haue neither leaſure nor abilitie to doe ſo, but I muſt want all theſe comforts. Chriſt knew that this would be as bitter as death to a Chriſtian ſoule, and therefore he wils them to pray to God to preuent it, that no ſuch neceſsitie be layd vpon them. Now if this commandement and this day had bene ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they might haue fled with as little care as any other, for it had bene aboliſhed long afore by Chriſts death, and no ſuch regard had bene to be made of it. In that Chriſt doth allow this conſcience and regard of flying on the ſabboth day, more then any other of the weeke, he ſhewes planly, that the force of the ſabboth was to abide after him for fortie yeres, and therfore no ceremony, for then Chriſt had not done well to put a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe feare into their harts of flying on the ſabboth, if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no keeping of the ſabboth, and then he ſhould rather haue bid them pray to God that they might haue had all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of it, being a ceremonie taken from them, and told them that they neede not to regard it, for it had bene a great ſinne to haue made ſuch conſcience of keeping a ceremonie ſo long after the aboliſhing of them, then if one ſhould not willingly and not without griefe fly to ſaue his naturall lyfe, when he
<pb facs="tcp:29174:73"/> ſhould be ſeeking to ſtrengthen his ſpirituall life, (as Chriſt words doe plainly proue) then how much leſſe ſhould he doe any other outward buſineſſe of far leſſe neceſsitie. So that theſe reaſons doe moſt effectually confirme to the harts of Gods children, that the keeping of the ſabboth day holy, is a moral law, and bindeth vs, and ſhall all to the ende of the world, as much as the Iewes, at any time before Chriſt. But for thoſe wicked perſons that will cauill againſt euery thing that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their corrupt luſt, as the keeping of a ſabboth doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, we muſt not greatly be moued what they object, for of them tis moſt true that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bray a foole in a morter as wheat is brayed with a peſtell, and hee will not forſake his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> But this may ſuffice to confirme and eſtabliſh and inſtruct a chriſtian, that with a true hart is willing to be taught, and to confound alſo, and condemne, and leaue without excuſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods judgement ſeat, ſuch as will not yeeld to playne and ſtrong reaſons drawne out of the word of God, but continue obſtinate in their falſe conceits. But becauſe the point may be more plaine and manifeſt; it is good to anſwere ſome of their objections, whereby they would ouerturne this plaine truth. Now the grand obiection is, becauſe we keep not the ſame ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both that the Iewes did, but the day is altered, therefore they ſay, we muſt keepe none. This is their argument of ſo great waight, but how fooliſh it ſhall appeare eaſily, if we examine it a little more narrowly. For though we keepe not the ſelfe ſame day that they did, yet we haue the ſame commandement &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for our day that that they had for theirs. Therfore this day that we keepe is called the Lords day, in Reuel. 1. Where <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was in the ſpirit vpon the Lords day.</hi> Afore it was called the day of reſt, becauſe God reſted on it, from the work of creation; but now it is called the Lords day, becauſe Chriſt Jeſus inſtituted it as a ſpeciall memoriall of his reſurrection &amp; perfecting of the work of our redemption. For the Apoſtles by the authoritie of that ſpirit which alwaies aſsiſted them in their miniſteriall office, did alter the day, &amp; themſelues kept &amp; ordained it to be kept in all the churches. As may appeare
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29174:73"/> 1. Cor. 16. 1. Where he ſaith, <hi>The firſt day of the weeke when yee meet together, &amp;c.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſhewes that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Chriſt were wont on the firſt day of the weeke to meet together, for the performance of all holy duties, of the number whereof collection for the poore was one, becauſe of the manifold perſecutions, wherwith in the primatiue church they were more afflicted and had neede of continuall reliefe. This was the firſt day of the Iewiſh weeke, &amp; our Lords day. So alſo in the Acts. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf kept this day, which he ſpent in preaching till midnight, and after adminiſtred the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in which two exerciſes, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued till the dawning of the day. So that the keeping of this day was inſtituted by God in the miniſtrie of the Apoſtles, and kept by them and the churches in their time, &amp; therfore as ſtrongly commands vs as the Iewes, and is of no leſſe force now then before. Then ſecondly, the reaſon of the chaunge, and of our keeping this day, is no leſſe then of their keeping that day: For when the creation of the world was, the greateſt work that euer was done, then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of that was chiefely to be regarded. But now that a greater &amp; more excellent work was done, namely, the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, it was reaſon that the greateſt work ſhould carry the credit of the day. They reſted the ſeauenth day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on that, God reſted from the work of creation; wee this eight day, becauſe in it Chriſt riſe againe from the work of our redemption; which being a greater work, cauſed a chaunge of the day. Sith then the day was not chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged without good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſtrong reaſon, that alteration and varying of the day detracts nothing from the truth and force of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And wheras they ſay, that the church may at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alter it, that is not ſo, for ther can neuer be an authority gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the authority of the Apoſtles, nor a cauſe, greater then the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the redemption of the church; and therefore neither can the day be chaunged, for to make a new day, where no ſuch warrant did allow, nor no cauſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, were to take more vpon them then is fit.</p>
               <p>For if the Iewes in former times were bound to keepe it
<pb facs="tcp:29174:74"/> holy, hauing onely the creation of the world to think vpon, and to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, by the celebrating of their ſeauenth day, then how much more are we bound to this reuerence and a greater, ſith beſids this benefit of our making, we haue a greater of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming by the bloud and death of Chriſt added vnto it, ſo that any one of the two ought to ſanctifie it more, rather then to caſt it of all together, and to be ſo much the more carefull to giue this day wholy to God, by how much he hath ſhewed a greate mercie to vs, ſo that we ſhould neuer ſpeake or think of this chaunge, but we ſhould alſo call to minde, this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which was the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had cauſe to ſpend a day in prayſing God for his creation, then wee haue greater cauſe, ſeeth beſides that we haue alſo the redemption to bee thankefull for. And if this bee a good argument, wee keepe not the ſelfe ſame day that the Iewes did, therefore the dutie is abolliſhed, and wee are bound to keepe none, then by the ſame reaſon one might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus: you ſee wee haue not the ſame ſacraments, for the outward ſeales that the Iewes had, for they had circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and they had the paſcall Lambe, what tell you mee of the conſecrate water, and of the bread and wine hallowed, the Iewes had no ſuch matter, ſith theſe ſignes be altered, I think it was but a ceremonie, and wee neede not regard baptiſme, &amp; the ſupper: this were no good argument in this caſe, for though the ſhadowes bee other, yet the ſubſtance bee the ſame, Chriſt Ieſus is ſignified by our bread and wine, as well as by their Lambe, and our baptiſme is the ſacrament of regeneration, as well as their circumciſion. Therefore wee ſhould not deſpiſe them, but ſo much the more bee carefull to prepare our ſelues for them, becauſe the ſeruice is more eaſie &amp; the promiſes more lightſome. If then it will not hold that we haue no ſacraments, becauſe the outward ſeales bee altered, then it is as weake a conſequence, that wee haue no ſeauenth day to bee ſanctified, becauſe the day is altered, and wee keepe not the ſame that they did. So that no proofe can be gathered from the varying of the daie, that the dutie is aboliſhed, becauſe the authoritie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29174:74"/> is as ſtrong, the reaſon as good, and the ſame reaſon doth not hold in other things.</p>
               <p>Againe they object that to a chriſtian euery day is a ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, and therefore wee ſhould not reſtraine it to one day more then another: but the anſwere to this is, that it is moſt falſe, for God doth not require neither is a chriſtian able to keep euery day a ſabboth day, ſo long as they remain on earth, indeede in heauen hee ſhall keepe a continuall ſabboth vnto the Lord, but now ſo long as wee liue, there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the ſabboth day and otheir daies, as betwixt the conſecrate bread wee receiue at the Lords table, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread wee receiue at our owne table. This is true that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one muſt ſerue God on the ſixe daies, and all his life long, but on the ſeauenth day wee muſt not onely ſerue God, but we muſt ſerue him in the duties of religion and mercy, onely. As for example, Gods children will not eat meat at their owne table, without crauing Gods bleſsing vpon them, but when they are to come to the table of the Lord, they vſe a greater and more ſolemne preparation, becauſe they expect a greater and more excellent bleſsing: ſo likewiſe a chriſtian in all the workes of his calling, hath a regard to ſerue and glorifie God, but in a more ſpeciall manner vpon the ſeauenth day, becauſe hee then lookes for a more plentifull and liberall benediction both vpon his ſoule and bodie; and theſe men that among vs keepe ſuch a prating that euery day muſt bee a ſabboth, and wee muſt reſt from ſinne, marke them whether they reſt from ſinne at all, and obſerue if there bee any families ſo bade as theirs, that commonly if one would rake hell, as wee ſay, hee could not meete with more prophane and irreligious perſons that ſpeake of keeping euery day holy, but in truth keepe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day vnholy; but others that in conſcience of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, doe binde themſelues to keeping of the ſabboth which God hath inſtituted, goe farre beyond them in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holineſſe, if they could ſhew any good effect in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of this their euerie day ſabboth, we might giue ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to them, for God doth alwaies giue a bleſsing to his owne
<pb facs="tcp:29174:75"/> ordinance, but for ſuch vilde and vnholy perſons, that in all their life neuer kept a ſabboth holy, to make a talke of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery day as a ſabboth, it is moſt palpable and damnable hipocriſie.</p>
               <p>The laſt objection of which wee will ſpeake, is taken out of 1. Coloſ. 2. 16. <hi>Let no man condemne you in reſpect of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday, or of a new moone, or of the ſabboth daies.</hi> So that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay they, puts the ſabboth among other ceremonies, which are to bee abrogated: but for the anſwering of this, we muſt know that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch ſabboths, as are in the ſame ranke with the meates and drinkes, whereof hee ſpeaks before of, which ſort were the firſt day of euery month, and the firſt and laſt day of euery one of their ſolemne feaſts, of theſe hee ſpeakes in the plurall number, and not of the ſabboth day, the Lords day in the ſingular number, which hath a ſinguler excellencie, and how euer times chaunge neuer changeth: then Eaſter and Penticoſt, and the other feaſts of like kinde, are indeede abrogated, as being ceremonies not written in the tables of ſtone as this was.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the proouing of this, that this ſabboth is morrall and perpetuall: which ſith it is ſo, the vſe is for the confutation of ſuch as ſharpen their tongues and wits, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their mouthes to ſpeake againſt it, not content to take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie themſelues, but would make a gap for others to breake out alſo. It is a vilde and notorious ſinne, to bee prophane in ones owne perſon, and to practiſe the breach of any of Gods commandements, but to draw others to impietie, and as much as they can to breake the yoke wherewith God hath yoked them, this is much more intollerable. This is juſt the diuell himſelfe, when hee had fallen from his vprightneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt God, the next worke hee tooke in hand was to allure <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, and make him as verie a rebell againſt God as himſelfe, ſo theſe wicked men, limmes of the diuell, that themſelues are corrupted and lie vnder the curſe of God, will take ſo much paines about nothing, as to peruert others, and being ſtark naught themſelues, to make all men if it might
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29174:75"/> bee like them.</p>
               <p>This alſo is for our inſtruction, that wee muſt ſo reſt vpon Gods reaſons, and ſo ſtand for his worſhip, as that euery blaſt and objection of a prophane perſon may not blow vs away, and weaken our reuerence to Gods ordinance: It is a great fault that wee are no better confirmed in the truth, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie breath of an heretique will put vs downe, and ſet vs to the wall as it were, that wee ſtand in a mammering, and know not whether wee goe right or wrong: it is an euident token that men bee ladenwith ſinnes, and carried away of their luſt, when the often preaching of the truth, cannot ſo eſtabliſh them it, as that they can ſay, we are ſo reſolued in our harts that this is the truth of God, as that by Gods mercie we had rather forſake our liues then forſake it, but none can attaine to ſuch knowledge, but ſuch as haue a pure and an vpright hart. And this that men be ſo quickly moued from the truth, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſtrength of the arguments made againſt it, but by reaſon of their owne weakneſſe, which haue not the ſpirit of truth to leade them into the truth, and to confirme and ſhew them errors and hereſies, and make them lothſome vnto them, and giue them power againſt them. Therfore we muſt labour for this ſpirit of truth, which may ſo ſettle and ground vs in the truth, as that euerie ſtorme of a falſe opinion from the mouth of ſome fantaſticall and vaine perſon, that hath no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe nor learning to commend him, that neuer did any thing nor ſuffered any thing for Chriſts ſake, may not weaken our hold, and ſhake our foundation, and caſt vs downe from the truth, that we ſhould be ſeduced by them. Nay, we ſhould be ſo far from yeelding to the falſe dreames of ſuch, as that when they grow obſtinate, we ſhould not ſhew the leaſt token of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, or any countenance, to them; we ſhould not entertaine them or receaue them to houſe, or bid them God ſpeed, for he that doth ſo as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, is pertaker of his euill deedes, becauſe in ſo doing, he confirmes them in their ſinne, &amp; brings himſelfe in certaine daunger to be infected by them. And thus much for that, that this keeping of a ſeauenth day holy, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:29174:76"/> it apart to the duties of religion onely, &amp; mercie is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and perpetuall dutie to continue while the world conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Now let vs come more perticulerly to the words of the commandement. Firſt for that word:</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Remember.</head>
                  <p>IN that God prefixed, in ſpeciall termes as it were of ſet purpoſe to meet with mens forgetfulneſſe, a memorandum heere more then in any other of the commandements, we may hence learne that who euer will faithfully and conſcionablie keepe the ſabboth when it is come, muſt before hand haue a ſpecial care &amp; a forecaſt to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe things that may hinder them in the keeping of it. A reaſon of this caueat which God giues, and of the dilligence that wee muſt haue in thus remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and preparing for the ſabboth, may bee drawne from our owne infirmitie, that vnleſſe wee bee very circumſpect, and caſt about with care indeede, wee are readie eaſily to let ſlip ſome buſineſſe, and leaue ſomething vndone which will then diſtract vs and draw our minds and bodies to, from gods ſeruice, ſome money to pay or to receiue, ſome journey to take, ſome odd thing or other, that beeing forgotten in time, will ruſh in vpon vs now, and muſt bee done now, becauſe it was omitted before, and cannot tarry till after; ſith then wee are ſo ſubject to diſtruction, and ſo ſoone to forget things, that if wee had had a care before, might haue beene done well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble in the ſabboth, but now through our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence comes vpon vs on that day, this muſt teach vs to haue a heauenly foreſight that wee prouide againſt all ſuch lets, and cut off by our godly care all ſuch incombrances. That pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and care which wee ſee in naturall men about the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of their bodies, we muſt learne for this market of our ſoule, they will bee prouiding and thinking before what they muſt buy at the market, and what they muſt carrie to the market, and will not haue the things to bee in doing, when they ſhould haue them ready to carry with them, but looke that the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29174:76"/> things they purpoſe to ſell be prepared, that ſo they may not be hindred but be there in good time to make their markets for their beſt aduantage. So if euer we will make good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for our ſoules, we muſt all the weeke before, be preparing our harts, and ſetting all things ſtraight, that our harts may be burdened with no ſinne nor no worldly care the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſhould carry away the force of our meditations &amp; thoughts from the exerciſes of religion; for they be ſpirituall and we be carnall, and a little thing God knowes, will make a great ſtirre in our fleſhly harts, to draw them from heauenly things, and therfore vnleſſe wee take great heede to examine our harts, and watch ouer our ſelues that we walke purely &amp; holily all the ſixe daies long, and to caſt out and diſcharge all affaires of this life on the one ſide, the ſinne committed on the other ſide, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe omitted will hale and pull our thoughts, that no atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be giuen to matters of religion; no conſtant or ſetled meditation of any heauenly thing can take place; we muſt therefore ſtop out all diſtractions and encombrances, &amp; rayſe vp our harts againſt deadneſſe and dulneſſe, which will make vs heauie and dull, and ſlow to any good thing, by a wiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and finiſhing our outward affaires, and a godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ordring and preparing our harts, if euer we will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably &amp; profitably ſpend the Lords day, in the Lords work. Then againe beſids theſe needleſſe lets, which through our owne weakneſſe we pul vpon our owne heads, therbe hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enough on euery ſide, which doe wee what wee can with all the induſtrie in the world, we ſhall neuer be able wholy to preuent, but they will ſet vpon vs. As in what family ſhall one come but he ſhall ſee idleneſſe and ſlepineſſe, and fooliſhneſſe manyfold wayes, &amp; who that knowes himſelfe any whit at all, doth not feele that he is readier to follow ill example, &amp; be led by ill company, then to be led by Gods commandement, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when no poſitiue law will take hold vpon him, for the breach of Gods commandement. And then we haue the diuel as a Lion continually ſeeking to deuoure our ſoules, &amp; to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs in all things he can from religion, and in the beſt there
<pb facs="tcp:29174:77"/> be ſuch ſtrong luſts, ſuch a loue of the pleaſure and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of this world, that vnleſſe we be ſtrongly garded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, will breake in vpon our harts, and diſorder the rank of our affections. As come to a profeſſour that is giuen to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and ouer to whome the world beares to great an hand, though he haue a true hart to God, and ſome ſound gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſpirit of God wrought in him, doe but vp ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous talke that tends toward gaine and filthie lucre, ſee if he will not be quite gone, and forgetting God and the ſabboth, and himſelfe and all, giue his hart and tongue and all, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd about worldly things, vnleſſe he mound and fence his hart about diligently with theſe thoughts, what though I doe, hath not god bidden me remember the ſabboth, hath he not ſet a ſpeciall mark vpon it, that I ſhould in no hand forget, &amp; thus by earneſt ſtriuing, ſhake of theſe vntimely words &amp; thoughts. And then we ſhall haue the world be objecting, and putting in it carnall reaſons to make vs negligent; why, what neede you be ſo ſtrict, this is to much niceneſſe, you are more preciſe then wiſe, and ſuch like; which will certainly carry one away vnleſſe he ſtriue to confirme himſelfe, by thinking on Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and ſo ſhut out theſe objections; what, hath not God bid mee remember, and ſhall I ſuffer men to make me forget it? hath not he giuen me two reaſons to keep it, the one ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Iewes had, and ſhall I be more negligent in keeping it, then they, which had but one? they had weaker meanes of comfort, the bloud of buls and goates, &amp; the ſprinkling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and an earthly tabernacle and high prieſt, and yet they were with reuerence to vſe theſe; and ſhall we, that haue more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes, as Chriſt Ieſus offered vp for a ſacrifice offered vp once for all, and the ſprinkling of his bloud to purifie our ſoules, and the heauenly tabernacle opened for vs, by him our heauenly high prieſt, and continuall mediator; ſhall we I ſay, that haue all theſe meanes, more plaine &amp; excellent then theirs, be negligent to keepe this ſabboth; eſpecially, ſith God hath giuen vs this as a meanes to draw vs from earth to heauen, and to make vs grow in a ſpirituall life. Hauing then all theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29174:77"/> vnleſſe we doe arme our ſelues in the weeke daye, and ſtrengthen our faith by remembring Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; reaſons, &amp; by a wiſe cutting of thoſe diſtractions which by diligence may be cut of, we cannot with any comfort or cherefully celebrate a ſabboth vnto the Lord. Laſtly, if wee reade the ſcriptures of God, and ſee how often God vrgeth this point, &amp; how earneſtly he preſſeth it, this will make vs labour often, and continually to call to minde that, which he ſo often hath repeated vnto vs, becauſe if it were a neceſſarie dutie, God will not ſo many times, in ſo many places require it at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. So that euery one muſt labour by ſearching his conſcience, &amp; watching ouer his ſoule, to rouſe himſelfe from that lumpiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and drouſineſſe which is within him; and by prouidence and forecaſt of outward buſineſſe, to put away all outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances and diſtractions.</p>
                  <p>This then ſerues firſt to confute thoſe that make this kinde of objections againſt the ſabboth; Oh we cannot keepe it, we ſhould bee vndone if wee ſhould reſt vpon the ſabboth day, for theſe loſſes and damages would enſue, theſe hurts would come, ſuch buſineſſes would bee left vndone; but I pray you whence come all theſe loſſes? what is the cauſe of theſe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? is it not becauſe you forget the verie firſt word of the commandement, <hi>Remember the ſabboth day.</hi> Then this is no warrant for vs to breake Gods commandement, becauſe wee had forgot that, which God bids vs remember: this is euen as if a man ſhould forget his purſe behind him, when hee went to the market, and when hee came to buy things wanting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his owne, ſhould goe and cut another bodies purſe, and then if one come and tell him, this is not honeſt dealing, it is plaine theft, and why would you bee ſo bold to cut your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours purſe? why alas neighbour, I hope I was in no fault, neceſsitie drew mee to it, for I had left my purſe at home, and I knew not how to doe for mony to buy my things, and to haue gone backe againe would haue beene to much paines. Why but doth this make it lawfull to cut your neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you had forgotten your owne, nay who ſhould haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb facs="tcp:29174:78"/> it, and not come to make ſuch ſhifts: and euen ſo men deale with God, oh they cannot chuſe but breake the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, they are driuen to it of force, neceſsitie compels them, and what neceſsitie? why, ſuch things lie to bee done that will bee ſpoiled elſe, why, but why did you forget them before, now ſhal your former forgetfulneſſe bee a warrant for you to ſteale Gods holy time, and abuſe it to vnholy things? Some hath a bonde to pay that will bee forfaited elſe: and why did you not remember before to make your condition with ſuch an exception, vnleſſe it were on the ſabboth, and then to defer it for ſome reaſonable time after, or ſome ſuch like condition? and ſo I haue this and this thing that muſt bee done, and why did not you thinke of this before to preuent it, as it is ſure you might, if you did ſerue God in your calling and not couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? ſo others ſay it is ſo tedious and irkſome to ſpend that day holy, that they cannot endure it; and why is it tedious to you? is it not becauſe you prepared not your ſoule to keepe it? you let ſinne keepe dominion in your hart all the weeke, and then it muſt needes bee dull and dead to all goodneſſe on the ſeauenth day, but thoſe that doe labour to walke vprightlie &amp; purely before God ſixe daies, finde ſuch comfort thereby, as no outward pleaſure can bring, nor anie thing in this world but onely the ordinances of God can afford.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs to lay as a dutie euery one vpon his owne conſcience, to remember this day, &amp; in all our affaires to haue this in our minde, that wee entangle not our ſelues by any buſineſſe which might hinder vs from keeping of it; firſt becauſe wee haue ſo direct an item as wee call it, to remember this day; ſecondly, becauſe whereas God contented himſelfe in all the other commandements, to ſet them downe either onely affirmatiuely or onely negatiuelie, hee hath not done ſo in this commandement, but to ſet the deeper impreſsion in our harts hath ſet it downe both affirmatiuelie and negatiuely, keepe it holy ſaith hee, and as though that were not inough, doe no manner of worke in it, and then wheras other of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements for the moſt part haue no reaſons annexed to them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29174:78"/> in the decalogue, though in the ſcripture elſe where they haue; this and the ſecond commandement haue diuers reaſons added vnto them, that men might haue a greater regard vnto it. Therefore if wee will doe any thing for Gods ſake, then doe this for his ſake: if a friend ſhould come to vs and ſay, I haue ſome ten errands, which I would haue you doe for mee, and I will recompence you throughly for your paines, but of all the ten there is one amongſt the reſt, which I would haue you eſpeciallie to remember, and of all loues ſee that you forget it not; would not one thinke him verie negligent and vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his friend, that would forget this of which he had ſuch a ſpeciall charge, eſpecially if his friend ſhould in moſt of the other giue but the bare commandement and thing ſet downe without any more words, but ſhould inſiſt vpon that, and giue him reaſon vpon reaſon why hee ſhould haue a ſpeciall care of it: but ſo God ſaith to vs, hee giues vs warning before, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wee are ready to forget it, but hee would haue vs ſtriue againſt this forgetfulneſſe, and then becauſe wee ſhould not forget but doe it, hee vrgeth it with many reaſons; now then to forget this is it not a plaine contempt and neglect?</p>
                  <p>It followes.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>To keepe it holy.</head>
                  <p>NOw the Lord ſhewes what is to bee done on the ſabboth day, namely wee muſt keepe it holy? it is not inough to forbeare our owne worke, and ſo to keepe it idly, but wee muſt bee as carefull to doe Gods worke, and ſo to keepe it holy. Hence then wee learne this doctrine, that the ſabboth muſt bee imployed in holy exerciſes, it muſt not bee a bare reſt, but a ſanctified reſt, ſo ceaſing from worldly things, as that we be taken vp in heauenly things, for idlenes is a ſin eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, but much more on the ſabboth. No man hath alowance in gods word to ſpend any time idly, but it is a damnable ſin in the weeke daies, much leſſe are we warranted to ſpend Gods time vnprofitablie and idly; of the twaine it were better leaue
<pb facs="tcp:29174:79"/> ones owne worke vndone, vpon ones owne daies permitted for his labour, then Gods worke on Gods daie appointed for his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons why this muſt bee ſpent onely in holie exerciſes, are taken from the ill effects that will follow if wee doe not ſpend it in theſe workes. Theſe ill effects wee ſhall ſee in Exod. 31. 12. Where God commands them that they ſhould abſtaine from all workes, and keepe it an holy, for if they doe worke euen in making garments and things for the temple, which ſeemed to pertaine to god, much more in things of their owne, theſe two euils will follow, firſt they ſhall die the death, their life ſhall bee taken away, they muſt die a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, and then ſecondly they muſt bee cut off from their people, j. bee ſubject to the curſe of God, and bee caſt off from the people of God, by ſolemne excommunication. Theſe bee the puniſhments of polluting the Sabboth, no ſmall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; and theſe God doth execute daily euen among vs, for though the law of the land takes not hold on ſuch perſons to put them to death, yet God giues them ouer to commit ſome ſinne which mans law puniſheth with death, and the firſt cauſe of all and that at which God ſtrikes, and which their owne ſoule feeles moſt heauie, as appeares by the daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, when they bee brought to execution, is, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer regarded the ſabboth, had no care to heare Gods word, &amp; to ſpend the day in duties of religion, &amp; in prayer, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after vanitie, and their owne luſt, and therfore God meets with them. And though the miniſter cannot by law excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them and caſt them out of the congregation, yet God excommunicates them, that in the harts of Gods people they be as heathen men, their ſoules are cut of from the church, they haue no lyfe of grace, no fruit or working of the word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, more then of any idle tale, and prophane ſtorie, no grace wrought by it, no death of ſinne, no hope nor deſire of heauen, but liue as beaſts; no recourſe to God in Chriſt Ieſus, nor no vertue that they draw from Chriſt, ſo that indeede they doe not liue in Chriſt, but are dead in their ſpirit, while they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29174:79"/> liue in their bodies. They may ſay indeed &amp; ſay true, that they can ſee no good by the exerciſes of the ſabboth, they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant to them, and vnprofitable, ſo that they haue no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it; and why is this, not becauſe Gods ordinances want their force &amp; vertue, but becauſe they want reuerence of them, and being wicked, contemne them; therfore their ſouls be cut of, their harts hardened, they haue forfaited their ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Then an other ill effect is, as in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17. where he ſaith, <hi>If they pollute his ſabboth, hee will kindle a fire in their houſes, that ſhall not be quenched.</hi> For their outward eſtate they be no gayners that breake the ſabboth for God ſends a curſe, which like a violent flame deuoures more then they can get. So that if we would not be guiltie of death, and haue our ſoules cut of from communion with Chriſt and his church, and our goods alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed &amp; brought to nothing by the vengeance of God? Then let vs keepe his holy ſabboth holy, and beſtow it vpon holy exerciſes. But on the contrary ſide, to ſanctifie it and ſpend in thoſe duties that God commandeth, brings all comfortable bleſsing and happineſſe. As in <hi>Iſai. 56. 2. If the gentils that be conuerted will keepe the ſabboth of God holy,</hi> he promiſeth that they ſhal haue a better name &amp; more reuerence then the Iewes that profeſſe the religion of God, but regard not his ſabboth, and at large there he ſhowes how he wil bleſſe them, and good reaſon to, for he that keeps the ſabboth aright, exerciſeth the whole bodie of religion, for this brings in practiſe the whole law, and teacheth one his dutie to God and to man, &amp; builds him vp in euerie grace. And ſo in <hi>Iſ. 58. 13. If thou turne away &amp;c.</hi> Where he ſhewes that if any man will on Gods day, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his owne work, and leaue of vaine words, and delight in the work of God, and his ſeruice, then God will giue them, God will ſet them on high, and giue them the inheritance of <hi>Iacob,</hi> for indeed then they be Gods ſheepe, and the flock of Chriſt, when they delight to follow him, and to heare his voice, for then they ſhall haue acceſſe to him, and he ſhall haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to bleſſe them, and dwell in them by his ſpirit. So that if we would auoid the curſe of God on our ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:80"/> and gaine the bleſsing of God vpon both. Let vs yeld to this his commandement, and with as great joye ſerue God in the duties of religion, &amp; his worſhip on that day, as we doe our ſelues in our owne affaires on the ſixe dayes; yea with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delight to, becauſe we haue a promiſe, and may looke for a greater bleſsing.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this is to reproue thoſe that thinke if they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from worke of their calling, that they take no paines in outward toyling about affaires of this world, then they keepe the ſabboth verie well, and if no man can accuſe them of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to plow or cart or ſuch workes, then they thinke they haue not broken the fourth commandement. But idleneſſe is a ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> naught euerie day, as we ſaid before, but much more naught vpon that day that ſhould bee ſpent in Gods exerciſes: But much more wicked are they, that bee euill occupied, in dauncing and dallying, in ſwilling and brawling, and ſo make it the diuels day inſteede of Gods, and doe more diſhonour to God, and hurt to their owne ſoules, then any day in the weeke elſe. Many alſo are to bee reprooued that will come to the church, &amp; for the time of the day will bee content to heare the word and doe ſuch exerciſes, but at euen when darkeneſſe comes, then comes the works of darkeneſſe, and when they be in their bed, then they bee plodding and caſting about for worldly affaires, and their heads be as buſie, &amp; as full of earthly matters, as any night in the weeke elſe. But wee are to know that the ſabboth containes foure and twentie houres, as well as any other day, and therefore the night muſt bee ſpent in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt to, elſe one ſhall hurt himſelfe more and diſpleaſe God more by theſe vaine thoughts in the night, then he could pleaſe God and benefit himſelfe by keeping himſelfe in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie and good actions in the day; and therefore they want the bleſsing becauſe they performe not all the dutie, and that which they did was in hipocriſie, becauſe they doe not care to remember that which they heard, nor examine with what hart and with what profit they haue performed the duties of the day; not but that a man may haue ſleepe, but his ſleepe is to bee ſeaſoned with the ſweetneſſe of the former exerciſes, &amp;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29174:80"/> his dreames haue ſome taſt of religion, more then at other times, and when they wake their thoughts &amp; meditations muſt bee carried after holy things, becauſe Gods eies are as faſt fixed on them in their bed, as in the church, and hee ſees and knowes their thoughts in the darke, as well as their behauiour and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the midſt of the congregation.</p>
                  <p>Now God bids vs keepe the whole ſeauenth daye, for he would haue vs giue as long a day to him as hee hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; and if day containe day and night, when he ſaith, ſixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, and we vpon that permiſsion and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Gods, take it for graunted, that in the night we may doe what buſineſſe we haue to doe, &amp; when we be in bed may ſpend the time in ordering our priuate affaires, and pondering how to deale in ſuch things as we haue to deale in, by reaſon of our calling. I ſay, if we doe this, and think as indeede it is true that he giues vs the night and day both for our callings, why is it not ſo in the ſabboth then, that he takes the ſeauenth day &amp; night to himſelfe as well as he giues ſixe to vs. Therefore we muſt know that the Lords day muſt containe xxiiij. houres, and for want of this, we depriue our ſelues of thoſe bleſsings which elſe we might haue, becauſe we vndoe that in the night that we did in the day, we did Gods work one part of his day, and that was well, but we take the remainder to our ſelues, &amp; that is a fault.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this teacheth vs to doe the duties of the Lords day vpon his day. Now this ſanctifying and keeping of it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſiſts in doing things either priuate or publique. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate are theſe; After examination of our owne harts, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our ſinfull wayes, with repentance and ſorrow for the ſame, to beſeech God that he would prepare and fit our harts to profit by the publique exerciſes of religion on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. And to entreat him that he would ſo direct the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters mouth, is that he may ſpeake to our harts, and ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſerues to kill our ſinne, and to comfort and build vp our ſouls, that as he is appointed for a phiſition, ſo he would fit vs with ſome medicine, as well as others, as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> bids them
<pb facs="tcp:29174:81"/> pray for him that he may haue the dore of vtterance; And when one doth this in an humble hart, deſiring to repent and turne from his ſinnes in good earneſt, he ſhall neuer come to the ſermon but he ſhall heare ſome one leſſon or other that will make him better, and he ſhal haue cauſe to thank God for it. But if one come rudely into Gods houſe from brauling &amp; chiding at home, or ſo ſoone as he is out of his bed to come to the church without preparing his hart or fitting himſelfe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayer to God, or confeſsion and ſorrow for his ſinne, then he ſhall feele, that to his vncleane hart all things are vncleane, the word ſhalbe but a tediouſneſſe, &amp; ſerue to the further hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his hart. Alſo one muſt reade ſome part of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture priuately, that may ſeaſon his hart, and ſettle and quiet his minde &amp; affections, that he may be more teachable. And that he may the better fit himſelfe after this ſort, he is to riſe betime in the morning, for there is none ſo good a maſter, no work ſo good in it ſelfe, nor none that will bring ſo great a reward, &amp; therefore we ſhould riſe as earely to ſerue this maſter in this work, as any day elſe for any other work, and if we doe thus, we may haue ſufficient to prouide for the publique exerciſes, that we may come vnto them with profit. Alſo an other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate work of the ſabboth is, to rele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue and viſit them that be ſick, or in any kinde of miſerie. And ſo alſo to reconcile thoſe that be at jarre and diſcord. Further, alſo to meditate vpon the word, that we haue heard, and to ponder of it, to apply it to our ſelues, to marke what we haue remembred, what we haue layd vp in our harts, and purpoſe to follow; and how matters ſtand betwixt God and our ſelues in the things that haue bene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, for till the word be thus made our own, it is but as chaffe lying looſe in the hart, that euery puffe of winde will driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and euery temptation will blow from vs. It is not as a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure locked vp that will ſtand vs in ſome ſteede in the time of neede. Likewiſe to confer with other chriſtians among whom we liue, &amp; to talke of the things taught, calling them to minde, and how they were prooued vnto vs, and then further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them according to our owne perticuler neceſsitie, and as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29174:81"/> it were to ſpread the medicine vpon one an others harts. Theſe be the priuate things, which as euery one is more careful to performe, ſo ſhal he receiue a more large and abundant bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon the publique. Now the publique themſelues are; To ioyne with the reſt of the congregaſion, in praying and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God with one hart and voice, in diligent attending to the word publikely read &amp; preached; for there is a greater bleſsing promiſed to this miniſteriall reading, then to any mans reading at home. Then alſo the vſe of the ſacraments, as to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at baptiſme, for the departing away, argues a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it, and with a publique diſgrace of Gods ordinance, for if one or two, haue libertie, the reſt haue the like, and then where were the reuerence. Therefore one muſt tarrie at ſuch exerciſes, as to ſhew his reuerence; ſo ſecondly, to help the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in prayſing God for ingrafting an other member into his viſible bodie of the church; &amp; to pray, that God would giue the inward working &amp; fruit of the ſame, by his holy ſpirit. And to edifie himſelfe alſo, by calling to minde, that he is alſo made pertaker of the new couenant, and joyned to Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And to examine himſelfe what fruit he hath felt in himſelfe of the death of Chriſt in killing his ſinne, and of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in raiſing him vp to newneſſe of life, &amp; ſo either to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, if he feele not that profit, he would; or to be thankfull, feeling this work of baptiſme, and to comfort himſelfe in the remembrance of this that the merite and vertue of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his death is his, to ſatiſfie for his ſinnes, and to kill by little and little, the power of them, all which things we ſee now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſealed vp to the partie baptiſed in the preſent action. For the baptiſing of the infant, is not onely for his profit, but for the good of all the church, that euery one may ſee his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and what God hath promiſed, and what benefit himſelfe is to receaue and looke for.</p>
                  <p>Another dutie, but priuate, is praier after the ſermon and publike meeting, that thoſe good things which one hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, may bee turned into a praier, which he muſt offer vnto God, beſeeching him that hath ſhewed him what is to be
<pb facs="tcp:29174:82"/> auoided, to giue him power to auoide it, and to encline his hart to keepe the things commanded, as well as to tell him the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that belongs vnto him, and as hee hath hard many ſweet promiſes, which will doe him no good ſo long as he hath an vnbeleeuing hart, &amp; cannot bring himſelfe to giue credit vnto them, therfore that God would alſo knit the promiſes vnto his hart, and giue him grace to truſt vpon them, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them when hee ſhall haue neede. Thus much for one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required to ſanctifie the ſabboth. Now the next words follow.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>IN which words God ſhews a reaſon why we ſhould obey this commandement. God hath giuen a man ſixe daies for the duties of his calling, but on this condition that hee ſhall contriue all his works ſo within the compaſſe of the ſixe daies, ſo that hee let none remaine till the ſeauenth, nor reſerue any outward thing to trouble him from the ſeruice of God, on the ſabboth. From this equitie God drawes a reaſon to moue euerie one of vs to keepe the ſabboth. From this we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Gods commandements are equall, as hee ſaith in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25. God deales with thoſe that charge his lawes of vnjuſtice, and ſhewes <hi>that his waies bee all together equall, &amp; the waies of man be vnequall.</hi> So 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. he ſaith, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God are eaſie, indeede to manie they be moſt tedious and heauie, but this is not from any vnequalneſſe in the law, but from the naughtineſſe of the men, that haue carnal harts, and worldly mindes, for if one haue ouercome the world and growne any thing ſpirituall, ſo farre Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are lightſome, the ſpirituall hart feedes vpon the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall law, and delights and rejoyceth in it. This muſt ſerue therefore to cut off thoſe dangers that men caſt to themſelues in keeping of this commandement, as though God had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot himſelfe in making ſuch an vnjuſt law, as no man can keepe it, but hee muſt bee vndone by it, as though hee knew
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29174:82"/> not what hee did when hee bad them reſt the ſabboth day. It is a meruailous impudencie in many that no man durſt ſpeake ſo hardly and preſumptuouſlie againſt any poſitiue law of the prince, as euerie baſe perſon will ſpeake againſt this law of God. Oh it is impoſsible to keepe it, ſuch loſſes it brings, and theſe damages it brings, that hee muſt needes come to beggerie that will obſerue it: what did God ſeeke the impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and the ſpoile of men, when hee bad them ſerue him? nay he appointed it as a day of bleſsing: and it ſeemes ſo hard and vnjuſt to them, becauſe they bee carnall, and fleſhly, and not hauing faith in Gods promiſes, nor any deſire to obey him, they will ſtill haue ſhifts, and ſomething to ſay againſt it, the hart is dead and wicked, or elſe the law would bring comfort. Oh how ſhould one doe for recreation, ſay ſome? is it not a recreation for a chriſtian to heare the voice of a chriſtian, and for a ſheepe of Chriſt to feede in his paſtures? is it not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation for a perſon condemned, to come where hee may get his pardon ſealed to him? is it not a recreation for a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death, to heare a direction that will leade him to life? therefore if wee were not altogether ſenceleſſe, and blockiſh in reſpect of ſpirituall ſence and life, it would bee as great a joy for vs to feede at his table, and in his houſe, vpon the bread of life, as in our owne houſes vpon corruptible bread. And againe could Chriſt finde in his hart for our ſakes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to beſtow his ſoule &amp; body, and giue his bodie to death, and his ſoule to ſuffer the wrath of God, and ſhall wee account it a burden to beſtow one day in ſeauen vpon him, to be made pertakers eſpeciallie of ſuch benefits. And God hath willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen vs ſixe for our calling, and may wee not well afford the ſeauenth to our ſoules? but wee haue ſuch buſineſſe wee cannot doe it. But for matter of buſineſſe God ſhewes two things, that if one would obſerue ſhould eaſilie preuent theſe buſineſſes: firſt ſixe daies ſhalt thou doe all thy work. Where hee ſhewes that if one would labour faithfullie and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie in their calling vpon ſixe daies, they might well diſpatch their buſineſſe, but indeede this makes men ſo loath to giue a
<pb facs="tcp:29174:83"/> ſeauenth day to God, becauſe hauing beene idle and vnthriftie on the ſixe, they haue neglected ſome buſineſſe that now lies vpon them the ſeauenth day, and then it is a great burden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and impoſsible for ſuch to keepe it, but they muſt looſe by it, but Gods commandement brings no ſuch loſſe, their owne ſinne is the cauſe of it: and if this bee not the cauſe, then the other is; men take more vpon them then their owne work, for if one take nothing but his worke, hee may diſpatch all well in ſixe daies, if one ſerue God in his calling, his calling will not hinder him from keeping Gods commandements; but if one ſerue couetouſneſſe and filthie lucre, then indeed hee can finde no time to ſerue God.</p>
                  <p>When men in haſt to bee rich, and eager deſire of wealth, will take more in their hands then they can mannage, this is their fault, and all this is not their worke, but the worke of their luſt, this is to bee a buſie bodie: but let any man bee faithfull in his calling on the ſixe daies, and not through greedineſſe encomber himſelfe with more then is needefull, and hee ſhall ſee hee may eaſily keepe this ſeauenth to God, there is no cauſe of ſuch complaining againſt it: And indeede to a ſpirituall hart, that hath any grace &amp; meaſure of Gods ſpirit, (how euer it ſeeme to carnall men) it is moſt juſt and equall, yea moſt ſweet and comfortable, ſo that they can with all their harts thanke God, that he hath giuen them one day wherein they may ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their harts, of all worldly cares, and throw of all griefes &amp; thoughts of debts, or ſuch like, to giue them ſelues wholy to ſeeke comfort in him, that will prouide for them in due time, and hath prouided this ſabboth, as an eaſe vnto them, that they ſhould not trouble them ſelues wtih any ſuch thoughts on that day. And thus much to proue that the keeping of a ſeauenth day, and ſpending it in holy dutie, is a morall law, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and belongs vnto vs as well as to the Iews, and ſo much the more vnto vs, becauſe we hauing more excellent meanes, a greater perfection is required of vs. As alſo to ſhew that euery one muſt make a preparation for the ſabboth. Both by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching his buſineſſe, as nothing may bee left vndone till the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29174:83"/> ſabboth: and by behauing himſelfe ſo in the buſineſſe, as his affections may not bee to much tied vnto them, for the former will hinder the reſt of the ſabboth, and the latter the holyneſſe of it. Therfore that we may keep an holie reſt; he muſt doe all that hee hath to doe vpon the ſixe daies, and if hee take more vpon him then he can finiſh in the ſpace of ſixe daies, it is more then God laies vpon him, and he doth not labour for conſcience ſake, but for couetouſneſſe ſake, and this is not his worke, but the worke of his corruption, and then ſecondly a man muſt draw his hart from the loue of the world &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and then neither worldlie loſſes will fill his hart full of worldlie greife, nor commodities with worldlie delight, which two things would hinder him from delighting in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exerciſes, ſo that he that will empty his hands of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie buſineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his hart of worldlie affections, ſhalbe able with comfort, to keepe a reſt and an holie reſt vnto God. And for the firſt reaſon drawne from the equitie of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, that hauing giuen vs the large allowance of ſixe daies, and taken the ſmall pittance of one daie vnto himſelfe, hath dealt in great equitie with vs, ſo that one muſt not goe about to make hipocriticall ſhifts and excuſes, for if he doe, it is not from the hardneſſe of the law, but the hardneſſe of his hart; not from difficultie in the thing, but want of loue in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for nothing is ſo eaſie, but a worldlie hart that loues not God will be ſhifting, and haue ſome odd reaſons againſt it. Now we muſt ſpeake of the ſecond reaſon.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>It is the ſabboth of the Lord thy God.</head>
                  <p>IN which God lets vs know, that he which is our God and the mightie ſtrong God, hath impropriated this to himſelfe, as his owne poſſeſsion, ſet a part for his owne ſeruice, therfore wee muſt willinglie let him haue it, and not intrude our ſelues vpon his inheritance, ſith god hath laid claime to it, it is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for man, to goe about to wrong him, that will not bee wronged. Hence then we learne this generall doctrine, that
<pb facs="tcp:29174:84"/> thoſe things, which God hath ſet apart for himſelfe, man muſt not ſet vpon, that which he hath ſanctified, for his proper vſe &amp; worſhip, man muſt not abuſe, to his profit or pleaſure. If any man be ſo bould to enter vpon Gods ſeuerals, hee may know before hand what ſucceſſe hee ſhall haue, namelie, hee ſhall ruſh vpon his owne deſtruction, for ſo the holy ghoſt ſaith by <hi>Saloman.</hi> Prouer. 20. 25. <hi>It is a deſtruction for one to deuoure holy things, and after the vow to enquire,</hi> If one will fill himſelfe with that which God hath made and appointed for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, let him take leaue, but withall let him know, that it ſhall bee no holeſome meat vnto him, hee ſhall bee poyſoned and deſtroyed by it.</p>
                  <p>And was not this true in <hi>Achan,</hi> God had taken the whole pray of Iericho, for his part, and that was a conſecrate thing, &amp; ſo he knew well enough, but yet he thought there was enough for God and for him to, and therefore he would be ſo bold as to take a little, thinking to haue benefited himſelfe and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by it. But what got he by it, was there not an hooke in the bayte that puld him into a fearefull and miſerable ende? Now if ſo fearefull a puniſhment befell him for deuouring of ſiluer or gold, for which God had not giuen ſo ſtrict a charge, nor backed his commandement with ſo much ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how much more then ſhall it bring in deuouring of holy time, which God hath more ſtrongly confirmed and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſo in <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. 8. 9. God complaines, that they had ſpoyled him in tithes and offerings, in conuerting theſe things that he had conſecrated for his vſe to their owne vſes. But what came vpon it? Therefore ſaith he, <hi>you are curſed with a curſe.</hi> I but we doe but as euery body doth, all the countrie doth ſo, why therfore ſaith he, you be all accurſed, euen this whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you will doe as euery bodie doth, this is all the help, they ſhall ſpeed as euery bodie doth, they ſhalbe accurſed for company, if they ſinne for company.</p>
                  <p>We know alſo in <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. That Chriſt cries out againſt thoſe which bought and ſolde in the Temple, and ſaith, <hi>they made it a den of theeues.</hi> Why, but is it theft to buy and ſell for their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29174:84"/> mony, to giue wares in exchange honeſtly for ſiluer, did they rob men becauſe they let them haue good ware for their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coyn. No, this was not the matter, they did not rob men, but they robbed God, for they did conuert that to prophane &amp; common vſes, which he had ordained onely for religious and holy vſes. Now if men rob God which abuſe the temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a ceremony, and then ſhortly to haue an ende, much more thoſe that abuſe his ſabboth, which is morall, to continue to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues then, to confute thoſe that will be bold and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous to doe the workes of their calling, vpon the Lords daye, and then if they be reproued for it. The anſwere is, why, what neede you make ſuch a ſtirre, I hope I am neither whore nor theefe? yes, they be theeues, and curſed theeues, and theeues that rob God, for the ſabboth day is his, in as much right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie as any of our goods is ours; many would be aſhamed if their ſonne or daughter, ſhould be found pilfering or priging, from their neighbour, and it is well they ſhould doe this, but theſe men are neuer a whit aſhamed that their ſonne or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould rob God of his daye, runne abroade to vanitie and dauncing, and wantonneſſe, vpon his ſabboth. That is youth, and it muſt be borne withall, nay, it is theft, and muſt not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for he that will deale thus vnfaithfully with God, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerue, will deale worſe with men, and he that is not holy in the firſt table can neuer be truely righteous in the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Then this ſerues for the inſtruction of thoſe that haue this waies dealt vnfaithfully with God, ſeruing their luſt, when they ſhould haue ſerued him, they muſt repent for this, and purpoſe hereafter to keepe it faithfully, and be as much afrayd to ſteale Gods time as mens goods, and to take away any part of the ſabboth, as the communion cup, or any ſuch like things, pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the church, for neither hath God taken that to himſelfe by ſo ſpeciall a commandement, neither is the taking away of that, ſo diſhonourable to God, and hurtfull to others and our ſelues, as of the ſabboth. But men will be objecting, what, ſhal men haue no recreation, ſhall our ſelues be ſtill toyling &amp; moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<pb facs="tcp:29174:85"/> No, God forbid, for a chriſtians life is full of joy &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and cannot want comfort. But if one will allow their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants recreation, let them allow part of their owne time, and be liberal in that which is theirs, not in that which god hath giuen them no ſuch warrant to giue to their ſeruants. This is a moſt ſhamefull excuſe, children and ſeruants muſt haue recreation, therfore they muſt needes diſhonour God, and rob him of his ſabboth.</p>
                  <p>How wicked this excuſe is, will appeare by the like: If ones children or ſeruants ſhould rob and ſteale other mens mony and goods, and they come to the houſehoulder and ſay vnto him, why will you ſuffer your children to do ſuch wrong to your neighbours? why alas you muſt beare with them, yong men muſt haue maintenance, they cannot haue meat &amp; drinke for nothing, they muſt needes get mony, I hope you will not ſo much condemne them for this, they doe it but for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, would you haue them ſtarue? no, nor I would not haue them ſteale neither, but ſith they muſt haue meat and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it is fit you ſhould allow it, and giue it them of your owne, and then they neede not ſteale? nay ſure you muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mee, I cannot ſpare ſo much monie, I had rather they ſteale it, then I giue it: what man would not thinke this mans excuſe very fooliſh and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>But now men deale as madly or more madly with God; children and ſeruants muſt haue recreation, and what of that? therefore wee will not ſpare it them from our owne ſeruice in the weeke, but they ſhall take Gods day for their delight if they will haue anie; this is a curſed ſhift, for if wee hire a day labourer and giue him wages, &amp; hee couenant to do our work for that day, and after an houre or two ſhould leaue off all, &amp; goe to follow his pleaſure, and ſay hee muſt haue recreation, wee would count him little better then a theefe or couſener, but God hath couenanted with vs to reward vs, and wee with him to obey him, and what is it but theft to doe thus, to take away part of his day, and the greateſt part too, for our owne luſts. Therefore though it bee an ill occupation, to rob men,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29174:85"/> and hee that doth it long is like to come to the gallowes, yer it is a worſe thing to rob God, and hee continues in doing that, ſhall finde a worſe puniſhment at length then hanging.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>In it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke.</head>
                  <p>HEe meanes workes of the world, and of ones worldly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for, for workes of religion thoſe are commanded, elſe God ſhould commaund idleneſſe vpon the ſabboth day, which hee doth not allow any day, therefore it forbids all manner of worldly buſineſſes, commanding the workes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and mercie. Hence then we learne, that no worldlie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe great or ſmall muſt bee done vpon the ſabboth, all worldly cares and queſtions, and workes muſt bee cut off. For ſmaller works, Exod. 16. wee haue a plaine proofe, where God condemnes them for gathering, yea for purpoſing to gather <hi>Manna</hi> on the ſabboth day: now what worke more eaſie then this; it was to bee done betweene fiue and ſixe in the morning or not long after, ſo that all the day after they might ſerue God, and they needed not take any great journey for it, goe but out of their dores a little, it was wont to bee there, nor the paines was not verie great, but to ſtoupe and take it vp, and there an end; and this is to bee noted by the way, that they went out &amp; found nothing, and ſo this is perpetuall, that whoſoeuer goes out to get any outward gaine on the Lords day gaines nothing, what euer hee thinke, certaine hee findes juſt nothing, Gods curſe eates vp more then his gaines. Now when they went but a little way, had but little time to ſpend, and it was no great paines to gather <hi>Manna,</hi> yet God ſaies for this, <hi>How long will this people breake all my commandements.</hi> It was but the breach of this one, and yet God chargeth them with the breach of all, becauſe in truth hee that makes a breach into this, ſets open a gap into all.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Luke.</hi> 23. in the two laſt verſes, it is noted of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and her companions, that hauing prepared their perfumes to annoint the dead body of Chriſt, and not hauing
<pb facs="tcp:29174:86"/> time to get readie inough for that purpoſe before the ſabboth came vpon them, they would neither annoint him with thoſe they had, nor buy any more till the ſabboth was ended: now what ſmaller thing then to buy a few ointments, that might ſoone bee done, and without great trouble, and if a man may doe any thing that is not a dutie of religion or mercie on that day, then he might buy ſweet ointments, to embalme the dead bodie of Chriſt, but becauſe Chriſts body was dead, and their embalming it, did yeld no eaſe and refreſhing, and ſo was no work of mercie, nor was not a worſhip of God, they durſt not doe it. I, but might one ſay, ſure they were more preciſe then wiſe, they made a ſcruple where none was, nay the holy ghoſt frees thee from that charge, and ſhewes that they reſted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandement. It was well done of them, for in doing it they obeyed Gods commandement, and it had ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe if they had not reſted, for then they had broken Gods commandement. So for the man that would gather ſticks vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſabboth, he did it in deede contemptuouſly, for to trie <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſet him at ſtand, he would breake the ſabboth, and yet not dye neither; therefore he did the ſmalleſt work, yet that little work was ſo great a ſinne, that God appoints him to be ſtoned to death for it. So that no work ſo ſmall, if it be a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter, and not a matter of religion, muſt be done. What ſmaller thing to ſtep ouer the dore-ſil, and gather a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet for a while, what thing of leſſe trouble then to buy ſome precious oyntment to embalme Chriſts bodie, what ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter then to gather a few ſticks, yet not the lighteſt of all theſe, but God condemnes it, and will not haue it breake into the poſſeſsion of his day.</p>
                  <p>Now for great matters, and affaires of importance, God doth not allow any worldly buſineſſe ſeeme it neuer ſo great, to ſhoulder out religion and mercie, vpon the ſabboth, all works great or not muſt yeld. As Exod. 31. 13. He commands that no man muſt doe any work for the building and ſetting forward of the ſanctuarie vpon the ſabboth, and yet that was a work of ſome waight, ſo that no thing ſo great that can beare one out
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29174:86"/> in breaking the ſabboth, one muſt not build a church on the ſabboth. So God commands expreſſely, that one ſhall not doe work vpon the ſabboth, neither in earing, nor harueſt. Now thoſe be matters of greateſt moment. If one may as it were ſtreyne curteſie for any thing, then he might to inne his corne, when it lies in the field, comes a faire day on the ſabboth, if he omit, it is catching weather, his corne is now readie, if he let it alone, he is like to looſe it, and to let it rot vpon the ground, why though it be Gods ſabboth muſt be inuiolable, better looſe all your corne then Gods fauour, better that rot in the ground, then we carry a rotten hart. So that it is plain, we muſt doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaſt nor moſt of our owne workes vpon the ſabboth day, none ſo little, that God will giue it allowance, to take vp of his time, none ſo great, that may thruſt out his exerciſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his commandement and the obedience we owe vnto him, is greater then all things. Therfore this confutes the ſhifts that men haue. Oh this is a trifle, ſuch a toy I hope doth not breake the ſabboth, as to ſet things in order, to lay the buck againſt munday morning, that is nothing, that is a ſmall work, but is it your owne work, then in the leaſt work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſayes, why doe you breake my commandements. So others hope they may ſet Ieauens, that is not ſuch a great matter; but it is a great matter, to doe the leaſt thing that God hath forbidden, and this is the next way to bring a curſe vpon themſelues and their dow to.</p>
                  <p>And others, oh it is a great and waightie matter, it lies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, &amp; concernes mine eſtate to doe it: but it is not ſo great as the obedience of God, and keeping of a good conſcience, better if one muſt, that ſome decay come to your outward eſtate, then to your ſoule. Is it of ſuch moment? and the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of your corne that lies in hazard like to bee ſpoiled by ill weather, yet you muſt not doe it, truſt in Gods prouidence, if hee haue commanded you to reſt, you ſhall bee no looſer by reſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnleſſe it bee your owne negligence that endamage you: for the Prince will not allow one to ſpit in his face, in jeſt or earneſt, nor will take it well if a man ſhould rob his treaſurie, becauſe hee needed twentie or fortie ſhillings or
<pb facs="tcp:29174:87"/> more, ſo God will not take in good part the breach of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and caſting his feare behind our backs in trifling things, or in matters that ſeeme to carrie more ſway with them.</p>
                  <p>But heere ſeemes to come in an objection, may one doe no buſineſſe, may not one looke to their cattle, ſerue their ſheepe or their horſes, and order them on the ſabboth? yes, a chriſtian man on the ſabboth day muſt ſerue his beaſt, but alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that hee doe it not as buſineſſe of his owne, but as a worke of mercie to the beaſt, not ſeeking or reſpecting his owne commoditie, as the creatures neceſsitie, and doing it thus for conſcience ſake, to help the poore creature, it is a work of the ſabboth, and in it place pleaſeth God; for God himſelfe commands to bee mercifull, euen to the beaſts, therefore one muſt ſee that hee doe it with a mercifull hart in compaſsion to the creature, ſo that the end muſt differ from the end in the working daies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his affection and meditation muſt be diuers from that hee may haue at other times; for this worke muſt raiſe him vp to ſome godly and ſpirituall meditations for his edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as for example, when one goes on the ſabboth to ſerue and order the dumbe creature, hee may make this vſe of it; why I can in obedience to God, and compaſsion to the creature, care for it, and bring it things neceſſatie, though it cannot call vpon mee, yet the verie neede of it cries loud, that I cannot but help though I bough it for monie; what care then muſt I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe God that is a ſea of mercie, of which I haue but one drop, will haue to mee, whom hee hath bought with the bloud of his Sonne, and which ceaſe not to call vpon him, and make continuall ſupplication for things needefull vnto him, &amp; ſo ſtrengthen ones faith: or elſe ſuch a meditation I ſee the poore dumbe beaſt that hath done mee painefull ſeruice all the weeke, when I come to ſerue it, is contented to bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at my pleaſure, if I giue it more it is content, if leſſe it doth not fret againſt me, if it bee better prouiſion it takes it in good part, if courſer, it doth not murmer and take on; why then ſhould not I bee content to liue at Gods finding, and take in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29174:87"/> good part that which hee giues mee, bee it more or leſſe, ſith it is my portion from God, eſpecially ſith I haue often rebelled againſt God as the poore beaſt neuer did againſt mee, and it hath done mee more faithfull ſeruice, then euer I did God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like meditations ones heart muſt bee ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned withall one the ſabboth day, more then neceſitie is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon him other times, If then our end bee mercie, and our affections bee holy in doing theſe things to the cattle, they be ſabboth dayes works, becauſe mercie is a work plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, on that day. But if one feede his cattle, not becauſe their want craues this at his hand, but becauſe his deſire of gaine moues him, they will be in better liking, and I may ſell them to more profit, or they will be better in hart, more able to doe my work after, and then his hart be carried after the gaine he may haue by theſe cattle, and his meditations taken vp with thinking how he may ſell them for moſt gaine, he breakes the ſabboth, he ſerues not God, but himſelfe, and though man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indite him for the very action, yet God will finde him out and plague him for the ill affection.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the things that muſt be done on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and thoſe that muſt not be done, and two reaſons taken, one from the equitie of the commandement, the other from the right and title of God, to the day. Now heere he comes after to a declaration of the perſons, ſeuerally comprehended vnder this commandement; naming firſt the gouernours, and then charging them with the inferiours, which are either continuall, as thoſe of the family, or for ſome time comming vnder their juriſdiction, as ſtrangers in the gate, to which the publique ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate muſt looke. Firſt he ſaith:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Thou.</head>
                  <p>BY this is ment, you which are maſter or miſtres in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for both are comprehended, becauſe heads thy ſonne and thy daughter. Now the ſonne and daughter pertaine equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to both the parents. I, might one ſay, I will keepe it holy,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:88"/> and reſt, but my children may work: nay ſaith he, thy ſonne, nor daughter. Naming them firſt, becauſe parents, through natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection, are readie to wink at them, &amp; to let it ſlip, though they prophane Gods ſabboth, by ſeeking their pleaſure, and they think, why alaſſe, youth muſt haue a ſwing, we muſt let them alone a little. Not ſo, ſaith the Lord, how euer you beare with them for others, yet you muſt looke to them carefully for that day, and not let them breake the ſabboth. Then he names the man, and mayde, becauſe commonly ſome lucre is gotten by their labour, and ſome commoditie ſeemes to follow, if they follow their worldly buſineſſe, men are ſlack to cauſe them to ſerue God, but would be content they ſhould ſerue them; God ſaith alſo looke to them, if any ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would be ſo wicked as to labour, yet thou muſt not ſuffer him receiue not this gaine, for it is the gaine of wickneſſe, and therefore accurſed, better bee without it then haue it. I, but I hope I may let my cattle bee imploied; nay ſaith the Lord, thy oxe, nor thine Aſſe, nor thy cattle, not becauſe the dumbe creatures can ſanctifie the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, but becauſe their labour cannot bee vſed, but ſome man muſt attend vpon them, and looke to them, and therefore God would preuent all occaſions of hindering mans reſt, wherein alſo God vnderſtands all ſuch other liueleſſe things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſet a worke without the hand of man bee joyned to them, as a mill, or a boat or ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Then he adds the ſtranger meeting one of an other nation and country and religion, wich though wee cannot compell to come to the church, yet the magiſtrate may and muſt forbid him to breake and pollute the ſabboth by any publique labour, if hee come in ſuch places where he hath authouritie. Here then wee ſee that God chargeth the maiſter of the family with all in the family, hee ſaith not you ſeruants and you children ſee that you breake not the ſabboth, but you maiſters labour not you ſelues, nor breake the ſabboth, nor ſuffer your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or ſeruants ſo to doe. Hence wee may gather this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that it belongs to all gouernours to ſee that their ſeruants inferiours what euer keepe the ſabboth. And
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29174:88"/> this teſtimony God himſelfe giues of <hi>Abraham</hi> I know him that hee will command his ſeruants and children to keepe my commandements, God knew <hi>Abrahams</hi> minde that if the caſe ſtood ſo that either ſome work of his muſt be neglected, or ſome ſeruice of God vndone; <hi>Abraham</hi> had rather that all his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe ſhould waite, then one part of Gods ſeruice be omitted. And great reaſon why a chriſtian ſhould bee of this mind, for if he do (as he profeſſeth) indeede loue god aboue all, ought he not to be more carefull of Gods glory then of his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, &amp; more ſee to gods ſeruice then his own gaine, now we know that maſters ſuffer not their ſeruants to be idle on the weeke days therfore if he loue god, he ſhuld be ſo much more diligent ouer them, that they neglect not the word of God on his day, by how much the glory of God, is more deare and precious to him, then his priuate commoditie. For as he that is a true ſubiect to the prince &amp; loues him indeed wil not keepe ſuch a man in his houſe that will not bee ſubiect to his lawes, ſo hee that is himſelfe rightly affected to God and his glory, will not ſuffer ſuch a prophane perſon vnder his roofe, that will diſhonour him openly, and not care to obſerue his ſabboth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if one beare any loue to his ſeruants or children, euen for their owne ſakes, hee muſt ſee to them that they breake not the ſabboth, but that they come to ſuch exerciſes where they may receiue the ſpirit of God, and the chiefe good to their ſoules: alwaies a good gouernour muſt gouerne for the good of thoſe that bee vnder him, now what greater good can hee doe to them, then to vſe thoſe meanes whereby they may know God in Chriſt Ieſus, and bee brought to ſaluation. So that if one will not ſhew a diſloyall hart againſt God, and vnlouing and vnfaithfull hart to his people, that hee cares not for their ſaluation, hee muſt ſee that they keepe the ſabboth ſo farre as it belongs to him, namely by being outwardly preſent at the workes of religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in regard of our owne good to, ſuch as be maſters muſt bee carefull ouer their ſeruants in this regard, for take this for a generall rule, hee that will not bee faithfull to God,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:89"/> will neuer bee faithfull to man, hee that hath no care to ſerue God in duties of religion, will haue leſſe care to ſerue his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the duties of his calling, as indeede they haue; for if the honour of God and their owne ſaluation will not moue them, why ſhould they bee moued for their maſters profit or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but hee that ſerues God with a good conſcience, will ſerue his maſter with a good conſcience, and though his maſter bee not preſent to rebuke him, his owne conſcience will checke him, and when the feare of his maſter will not keepe from idleneſſe and vntruſtineſſe, the feare of God will keepe him, and the commandement of God will reſtraine him: elſe either they will doe nothing, or what they doe is all for eie ſeruice to bee ſeene of men, and when the maſters eie is off, then by idleneſſe or waſtfulneſſe or pilfering they will hurt one more then the faithfull keeping of the ſabboth can hinder them, for that will not hinder them at all, but bee a meanes to bring, the bleſsing of God on their labours in the weeke day. As <hi>Iacob</hi> a faithfull ſeruant to God, was bleſſed in all <hi>Labans</hi> buſineſſe, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a true worſhipper of the Lord, had proſperitie to follow him, and accompanie him in all his trauailes. Therfore if wee will ſhew our loue to God, and to them, and deſire that they bee faithfull to vs, and God ſhould bleſſe their labours in our affaires, bring them to the ſeruice of God, and exerciſes of religion on the ſabboth, and haue a care that they breake not the holy day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues for the reproofe of thoſe men which beare this minde toward their ſeruants, that ſo their owne worke be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they care not how Gods worke is neglected, let their ſeruants bee carefull to doe their buſineſſe on the ſixe daies, &amp; let them bee as careleſſe as they liſt of Gods, on the ſeauenth day, let them ſpend it euen how they will, they haue free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the maſters. This ſhewes men to bee louers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more then louers of God, and proues that they loue fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lucre and gaine of the world, more then the glorie of God, for if Gods glorie were but as deere to them as their monie, they would bee as impatient at his diſhonour by their ſeruants
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29174:89"/> negligence, as at loſſes that come to themſelues by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants negligence. Oh but they ſay they be rude youthes and will break out from vs, we cannot keepe them in. Be not theſe deepe diſſemblers? is not this groſſe hipocriſie, can you not keepe them in? Who keepes them in on the ſixe dayes, can you make them tarry at home then, can you ſet them to their buſineſſe, and not ſuffer them to be gadding, yet that is for ſixe dayes ſpace, this is but for one, that labour which then they doe is far more toyleſome to the bodie, &amp; can you make them will they nill they, ſpend ſixe whole dayes in more painefull &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious work, &amp; can you not conſtraine them to keepe at home and doe more eaſie works in reſpect of bodily labour, and that but for one whole day? this is miſerable ſhifting, &amp; plaine halting, theſe excuſes will not holde before God, he will ſhew you that you had made as much account of ſeruing his honour and glory, and obeying his commandement, as you doe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing your owne filthie couetous luſt, and obeying the diuell, if his name had bene as deere to you as gayne, you might with as much eaſe, cauſe your ſeruants to ſpend the ſeauenth day, in his ſeruice to his glory, as ſixe before it in your owne ſeruice to your profit. But what is the cauſe that youth is ſo rude, is it not becauſe they haue learnt it of age? Why, be inferiours ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but becauſe they follow the patterne and tread in the ſteps of their ſuperiours? how come the branches to bring ſuch ill fruit, but that the root hath no better ſap, for if the ſeruants might but ſee ſo much loue of God and care of keeping gods commandements, appeare in the conuerſation of their maſters and dames, as they ſee of the world and eagerneſſe after lucre, they would at leaſt for outward ſhew be better. But now that they ſee their maſters and know his diſpoſition, they frame themſelues thereafter to ſerue him in his couetous luſt, &amp; rob God of his honour.</p>
                  <p>If the ſeruant ſhould but leaue his buſineſſe one or two houres in the weake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and runne hoyting about ſome ſports and vanities, when hee comes home his maſter will bee vpon his backe, his dame would haue a ſaying to him, hee ſhould be ſo
<pb facs="tcp:29174:90"/> bayted with rebukes and chiding, as if it were a beare with dogs, ſo that though hee had a good minde to bee abroad, and had no great hart to ſtand ſweating at his buſineſſe, yet miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feare would make him tarrie at home, rather then he would endure the ſharp ſauce that muſt come after, and bee chidden thus againe, hee will keepe within doores; but let him be where hee will; and doe what hee will vpon the ſabboth day, when he comes home either his maſter or dame allow him in it, or elſe they bee mute and ſay nothing to him, or if they doe begin to reprooue him, it is done ſo coldly, ſo careleſlie, with ſo little vehemencie, that the ſeruant may well perceiue it comes from the teeth outward, his maſter is not greatlie ſorrie within, it neuer vexeth his hart for the matter, and therefore hee cares not for ſuch chiding, hee will to it the next ſabboth againe.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly this ſerues for the inſtruction of all houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, that deſire to bee indeede, as well as to bee accounted chriſtians, that they ſhould haue an eie to their ſeruants in the keeping of the ſabboth. Euen as one the weeke day, they will call them vp, and ſee that they bee readie to their buſineſſe, ſo on the ſabboth cal them vp in the morning, &amp; ſee that they be readie for the worke of God; eſpecially ſith the works of their calling bee ſuch as they may doe without any great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A man may riſe out of his bed, and goe ſtraight and hold the plow, or driue the cart as well as if hee had an houres conſideration, but vnleſſe one haue ſometime to diſburden his hart of worldly thoughts, and to fit himſelfe by prayer &amp; holie meditations to heare the word, hee can neuer doe it well, nor ſo as the word will bee profitable vnto him, therefore they muſt bee ſtirred vp, that they may haue time to make readie their harts, that they come before God with a quiet an emptie minde.</p>
                  <p>Now in this dutie many of Gods children faile, that euen themſelues and their whole family take libertie to ſleep out a great part of the morning, and thinke it inough to riſe and goe to church, not regarding any time of preparation, and hence it is that the exerciſes be ſo vncomfortable and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29174:90"/> to them. And then ſecondlie the maiſter muſt bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to haue his family come with him in good &amp; due ſeaſon to the houſe of God, with the whole congregation; not as many doe, that are ſo negligent, as much is paſt before they come. The wife comes at the ſecond leſſon, &amp; he drops in at the end of praier, and the ſeruants follow when halfe is done. They would not doe thus to harueſt worke, but he would make them get all things readie, that they goe together to get in his corne, and not come dropping, one now, and another anone; why ſhould not one therfore be as carefull for the foode of his ſoule, and to eate of the bread of life, in the houſe of god, to come joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie himſelfe and his wife, and bring their familie with them, that they may be at the beginning, and tarrie out till the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; that they may haue the whole fruit, and not as ſome doe bee gone before the ſermon end, or at leaſt, runne away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the praier be made for a bleſsing, and the bleſsing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the miniſter; which ſhewes they neuer felt the goodneſſe of the bleſsing, they are ſo loth to tarrie the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters prayer, becauſe they want the ſpirit of prayer themſelues, and cannot tell the benefit of a faithfull prayer, for if the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of gods bleſsing had diſtild vpon their ſoules, or they had neuer felt the comfors that follows, a prayer made in the holy ghoſt, they would be more deſirous of theſe things then they be, and not haſt ſo from them, as if it were a curſe, not a bleſsing, and ſome things tending to their hurt, not a ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God for their good. And as they muſt call them vp in the morning, ſo an other dutie is to examine them after, and call them to account how they haue profited, as if mens ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants be ſent to the market, they will not let them goe without takeing account, how they haue done their buſineſſe, and what markets they haue made, ſo when they come from the church, they come from the market of their ſoules, they ſhould queſtion with them, to ſee what good bargaines they haue made for their ſoules, what profit they haue had by comming to Gods ordinances, and thus laying their ſtore together to help one another.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:91"/>
                  <p>This ſerues alſo for the inſtruction of ſeruants, that ſith God hath layde ſuch a charge vpon their ſuperiours, to looke that they keepe his ſabboth; therefore they ſhould willingly be ruled, and ſuffer themſelues to be guided by them in this point, and as well obey them in the ſabboth; to be diligent in the works of God, as in the weeke daies to obey them, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their owne calling. They muſt not ſay as many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſeruants will, if they call them and will inſtruct them in religion, they will none of that, but you hired me ſay they, to doe your work, and take my wages, and there an ende, what needes all this doe about keeping the ſabboth, and comming to the ſermon, let mee looke to that my ſelfe. Nay, but if they be Gods ſeruants, and you Gods ſeruants, your maſters hired you to doe Gods work, and in the Lord to doe their work, therfore this is a prophane anſwere, and theſe be ill ſeruants. But much more vilde are they that will runne abroad to wickedneſſe, to dauncing, to ſwilling to wantonneſſe &amp;c. making that their ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both daies work, which is vnlawfull at any time, to plow and to cart be things lawfull and profitable in fit time, but to daunce and follow wantonneſſe, is naught euery day, but much more vilde and abhominable vpon the ſabboth day. Therfore ſuch ſeruants muſt by force be conſtrained not to violate Gods ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, or if no meanes will ſerue, a chriſtian maſter muſt not haue his houſe peſtered with ſuch open rebells againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Thus much God ſhewes the duties of chriſtian houſholders, that they muſt themſelues and ſee that their ſeruants abſtaine from all the works of their calling, and doe onely works of pietie and mercie, which works of mercie they muſt not doe, vpon the Lords day, in loue to their owne commoditie, but in obedience to God and compaſsion of the creature. Now the Lord goes further to ſhew what courſe muſt be taken with men of an other religion, ſaying:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Nor the ſtranger that is within thy gates.</head>
                  <p>HEere hee ſhewes that if a ſtranger come within our iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that are chriſtians, though we cannot command
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29174:91"/> him to come to the exerciſes of religion, yet the magiſtrate muſt not ſuffer him to doe any ſeruile worke to pollute the ſabboth, for by the gates heere the Lord meanes authoritie and juriſdiction, becauſe in former time the place of judgement and where authoritie was exerciſed was in the gates. Hence then in that the magiſtrate muſt looke to forreyners, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doctrine may bee gathered, that it is our dutie being chriſtians, not onely to keepe the ſabboth our ſelues, and to looke to thoſe that are belonging to vs, but ſo farre as we can euen to ſtrangers, or to any other. And this is that which is commended in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that when the men of Sidon that knew not God, nor cared not for the ſabboth, came with wares to Ieruſalem on the ſabboth, hee ſhut the gates againſt them, and tolde them, that if they did ſo any more, hee would laie hands vpon them.</p>
                  <p>And there is great reaſon why one ſhould bee carefull of thoſe of other congregations, and of other places, for if wee haue the true loue of God in vs, it will grieue vs to the hart to ſee gods name diſhonoured, and his lawes broken of any one whoſoeuer, and therefore ſo much as in him lies, hee ſtop all ſuch practiſes who euer they bee that doe them. Alſo euerie man is bound to loue his enemie, yea his enemies beaſt, and if hee ſee his enemies beaſt vnder his burden, hee muſt help him vp, if one muſt help a mans oxe or aſſe, if hee bee bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, much more his ſoule, that is burdened with the ſinne that will kill it, if it bee not taken off. No man is ſo ſauage that if hee ſee a blinde man running into a well, wherein hee may bee drowned, will ſay let him goe I care not, hee is none of my family, nor of my friends, though hee bee not, mercie is to bee ſhewed to all, and nature in ſuch a caſe will teach one to runne and call to him, and hinder him by what meanes he can. So for the ſoule much more, if wee ſee a perſon who is in truth blinded through ignorance, and knowes not the danger, about to caſt himſelfe into the pit of hell, mercie will moue him that hath any true mercie, to ſeeke to reclaime him.</p>
                  <p>And then in regard of the good of the whole congregation,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:92"/> one muſt hinder ſtrangers from giuing ſuch ill examples, for though it ſeeme at firſt a ſmall thing to ſuffer a ſtranger, let him doe what hee liſt, it pertaines not to vs, yet it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for our nature is ſo ſubiect to infection, and we ſo eaſilie drawne to euill, that if one ſuffer a ſtranger, at length his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants will learne and come after, to doe the ſame things; ſo that for our owne ſakes wee muſt be diligent, to cut of occaſions, and warilie preuent danger, for one houſe on fire may burne the whole towne, and if a ſtranger would buy an houſe in the towne, and then be ſo fooliſh to ſet it on fire, men would not let him alone, for feare it ſhould alſo catch their houſes, and ſo in truth if the fire of ſinne kindle in the heart &amp; practiſe of a ſtranger, &amp; we ſeeke not to quench &amp; ſuppreſſe it, it will not tarrie there long, it will catch ſome in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſet them a burning to. Therfore in loue to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to our brothers ſoule, and to our ſelues, and thoſe that bee neere vnto vs, we muſt labour by what meanes wee can, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euen a ſtranger from breaking the ſabboth; now if one muſt hinder ſtrangers, how much more ſuch as bee borne and dwell in the ſame place, our neighbours, children, or ſeruants, if wee ſee ſuch prophaning the ſabboth, we ſhould much more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by admonition and reproofe, but eſpeciallie if we ſee them run to things that be ſimply euill, and in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all times vnlawfull: therefore for men that be of ſome account &amp; note in a congregation, in a towne to come among headdie youths, and ſee them violenly carried to dauncing, to gaming, or any ſuch lewdeneſſe, on the ſabboth eſpecially, and let them goe on without any rebuke or exhortation, neuer tell them of it, neuer dehort them from it, this ſhewes that there is but a little loue of God in none of the parties ſoules, and that they haue little regard of themſelues and their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. But in truth, this is the cauſe that makes wickedneſſe grow ſo faſt, and ſinne get vp with an high hand, and youth grow to ſuch impudent and ſhameleſſe boldneſſe, becauſe the miniſter fights alone againſt ſinne; None elſe will open his mouth to ſpeake againſt it, or diſcountenance it, he that would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29174:92"/> not ſtand by and ſee the Oxe fall into the ditch, but he would help him out, will looke on while the children runne headlong towards hell, and ſay not a word to reclaime them. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeneſſe of men that are of ſome eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the town, makes proud youthes oft times ſo audacious to ſet themſelues openly againſt the miniſters doctrine, and as it were by their practiſe in the heat of luſt to contrary him, euen when he is reprouing any ſinne, when the doctrine is yet hot, and the ſound of his voice is ſcarce gone out of their eares, then to runne openly to gaineſay that which was taught in the church, ſo ſoone as they come out of the church.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrength of impietie proceedes hence I ſay that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hath no help, none hath a zeale of Gods glory, ſo that he is grieued at his diſhonour, none hath ſo much charitie and compaſsion ouer their neighbours, as that they ſeeke to pull them out of the daunger of hell fire, for if but two or three or ſome more of the auncient men that haue ſome authoritie and ſway in the congregation, would ioyne their hands with the miniſter, and ſet in with their priuate rebukes and reprofes, to make his publique reprofes forcible, younger people would be more aſhamed of ſinne, and learne to behaue themſelues more ſoberly, then in publique as it were, to bid battaile to the publique doctrine of the miniſter. Therfore this ſlackneſſe and coldneſſe, is much to be reproued.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, this is for the encouragement of ſuch as doe deſire to help others out of this or any other ſinne, they may boldly with a good hart and conſcience, rebuke a ſabboth breaker, wheras they will object, why, what is that to you, if I ſinne my ſelfe, I muſt periſh my ſelfe, what haue you to doe to meddle, yes, they haue to doe to meddle, they haue to loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue to loue the congregation, and to loue Gods glory, &amp; therfore as much as they can to diſgrace ſinne, for though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners begin to ſet ſinne a foote, yet if ſome godly wiſe man will encounter it with a ſound admonition and ſharp rebuke, that will daſh and diſgrace it, as much as the practiſe of ſinners will ſupport it, ſo that it cannot get an head ſo ſoone. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:29174:93"/> becauſe they be men that ſinne, and it is Gods law that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the whole congregation that is infected &amp; poyſoned, he that hath that affection he ſhould to any of theſe, hath to doe to vſe a preſeruatiue againſt this poiſon, and to ſtand for Gods commandements, and the ſaluation of man; let wicked ſinners while they will accuſe them to be buſie bodies, that is no matter, better diſpleaſe man by good, then God by euill. It followes.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For in ſixe daies the Lord made heauen and earth, the ſea, &amp;c. and reſted the ſeauenth day.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe this commandement is much oppugned by the examples of great men, becauſe almoſt all men breake it, therefore it is confirmed from the example of the great God, whoſe example is able to counteruaile all theirs, <hi>q. d.</hi> If you will bee led by example, follow the moſt perfect exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; now what more perfecter example then the example of God, who hath propoſed himſelfe for a preſident, ſinfull men breake it, but the holy God kept it, and would haue you keepe it, whether example is beſt to follow? God made an end of all in ſixe daies, and ceaſed creating on the ſeauenth day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would haue you ceaſe from the workes of your voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, for workes of preſeruation Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn. 5. My father worketh hetherto, and I worke.</hi> But hee ceaſed workes of creation, ſo that the reaſon ſtands thus, God left no worke of creation till the ſeauenth day, but ended all in ſixe daies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would haue you end all your workes of vocation in ſixe daies, and giue the ſeauenth onely to workes of ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>Hence then we learne this doctrine, that whoſoeuer deſires to liue godly, muſt propoſe the example of God to himſelfe to imitate. Thus Epheſians. 5. 1. The Apoſtle wiſheth them to follow the example of God as deere children, he had before exhorted them to gentleneſſe and courteouſneſſe: but hee hath done me wrong ſaith ſome man, how can I deale kindly with him? why freelie forgiue him, ſaith the Apoſtle. But who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29174:93"/> would put vp this wrong patientlie, God would, and therefore doe you follow god, and imitate him, God doth not preſentlie ſeeke reuenge, if any man breake his lawes, but vſeth all gentle meanes to bring him to repentance, and to cauſe him to turne, ſo doe you, then tread in Gods ſteps, indeede ſome froward man would take a more violent and boyſterous courſe; But if you will be accounted the child of God, bought with the bloud of Chriſt, and regenerate by the ſpirit of God, you muſt rather bee directed by his example then mans, and then no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that you bee the ſonnes of God, and no ſurer proofe that he hath begotten you to life eternall, then when you grow like vnto him, and ſhew foorth his image in your life.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why it is beſt to ſet God before vs, as a patterne, is, becauſe his example is ſo abſolute in all fulneſſe of perfection, that no exception can bee taken againſt it: bring the example and there is ſome thing againſt which a man may except to leſſen the force of it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſuch good men haue had their ſlips, and no man liues ſo holy but as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>In ſome things wee ſinne all.</hi> But the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is ſo exact and altogether righteous, without any ſpot at any time, that no ſuch thing can be alleadged againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if one make God his example hee ſhall grow better and better, becauſe ſtill he ſhall come ſhort of the mark he aymes at, &amp; neuer be able to attaine to the perfection which is in his example, ſo that ſtill he ſhall haue a proportion to goe on and to grow. If one ſet man for his coppie, either he may write as well as his coppie, or at leaſt he may imagine that he doth &amp; then he ſtands at a ſtay, and thinks he hath done well, he may ceaſe now, but this example is not ſubiect to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, no man either can or will dreame that he can be as good as God, ſo that heere is ſtill occaſion of mending and encreaſing. Thirdly, he that followes the example of men, hath great meanes of pride, and to be puft vp, for comparing himſelfe with men, he is not put in minde of his faults, but rather thinks this &amp; this I haue done, and in moſt things I am equall to the beſt, and ſo is in great daunger to grow conceited of himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:94"/> but now he leauing men, lookes vnto God, and caſts his eyes firſt on God, and then on himſelfe, he ſees ſo much imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in himſelfe, and ſuch infinite righteouſneſſe and goodneſſe in God, as that vpon this compariſon, he growes more humble and holy, and to know himſelfe more, ſo that though he grow better euery day then other, yet he thinks worſe of himſelfe euery day then other, and hath a greater inſight into his owne corruption, by how much, he gets more ſtrength againſt his corruption. In theſe regards therfore, and for theſe reaſons, it is moſt ſafe and profitable, to make Gods example a line for himſelfe, and to follow his preſident, ſo neere as he can in all things.</p>
                  <p>This then may ſerue to the confutation of thoſe men, that letting paſſe Gods example as nothing pertaining to them, thinke to daſh all commandements, and all rebukes, with this one anſwere, that all men doe ſo, as though it were a ſufficient buckler to beare off all Gods commandements, and the force of his example, becauſe the example of moſt men is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: as namely in this one commandement, which of all the reſt God hath moſt ſtrongly fenced with reaſons &amp; among other, with one drawne from his owne practiſe and example. Come to ſabboth breakers that abuſe it to ſinne and vanitie, how dare you bee ſo bolde, as to breake Gods expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement with ſo high an hand, and to prouoke him to his face thus? why I hope wee are not thoſe that alone play vpon the ſabboth, wee ſhall doe as well as others, all the townes round about vs doe the like, but why ſhould not you looke to Gods commandement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and example rather then to wicked men; would a father take this for a good anſwere if he ſhould come to his childe &amp; ſay, why do you lie or ſteale, know you not that it offends mee, and I like it not? why ſhould you chide mee, I hope I am not the firſt that euer ſwore, other children haue lyed &amp; ſtolne before me, what need you be ſo angry with me for the matter, no father would endure ſuch an anſwere of his childe; this manner of defending were worſe then the fault. But ſo we deale with God, he ſends his miniſters to reproue vs, &amp;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29174:94"/> ſay, why doe you diſhonour the name of God, and breake his commandement and ſabboth? why I hope others doe ſo as well as I, this is the moſt common aunſwere. But ſhould not a childe be ruled by his father? ſhould not a ſeruant follow his maſter? and ſhould not the children of God follow God? and be content to be ruled both by his commandement and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? What a miſerable thing is this, that we will forſake the light to runne to darkneſſe, and leaue God, to goe after Beliall. The way is not broad, that leades to heauen, nor many walke in it, their ſinnes are no warrant for vs to ſinne, but if we be Gods, then let vs follow God, as deare children.</p>
                  <p>So, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. verſe. <hi>If wee walke in darkneſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhewes that if we be in Chriſt, we muſt walk as Chriſt walked, for if one ſhould ſay, this is a member of the bodie, whereof this is the head, and the head goe eaſt, and the member weſt, no man would beleeue it, ſo if we ſay Chriſt is our head, but we goe a quite contrary way to that in which he went, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether falſe, and a lye, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith; but if Chriſt be our head, let vs walke in the light wherein he walked, let vs treade in his ſteps of meekeneſſe, of denying the world, and of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our joy in heauen, and thoſe vertues that ſhined in him, let them appeare in vs, though not in the ſame meaſure, yet in the ſame manner and truth, for the like meaſure is impoſsible, to vs, but the like truth and vprightneſſe is not onely poſsible, but ſo neceſſarie, that without it we can haue no aſſurance, that we are in him.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues likewiſe for the encouragement and comfort of Gods children, that liue in ſuch prophane places, where they can haue no patterne of godlineſſe in man, nor none that will joyne with them in any holy thing, as it often times falls out. Then the diuell is readie to object againſt them, and to hinder them with this objection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going on; what will you be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, will you be one alone, without any example? No, they are not without example, but they follow the beſt exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, euen the example of God, and it is far better to bee lead by his example to heauen, though fooliſh men mock them, then by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:29174:95"/> men to be drawne to hell, and haue God to plague them, his one example ſhould more encourage and ſtrengthen vs, then all their contrary practiſes diſcourage or feare vs. O will you keep the ſabboth ſo ſtrictly, that you will not play among your neighbours, &amp; do as euery body doth, they will mock you and hate you, and count you more preciſe then wiſe. Well, if they doe, yet a chriſtian may beare off all, with this I know God will loue and allow mee for it, he commands to do as he did, he created all things in ſixe dayes, and one day, the ſabboth onely, preſerued; therefore I muſt ceaſe from works of my calling, &amp; doe thoſe works whereby I may preſerue mine owne ſoule or others, therefore let the world, goe which way it will, wee will walke in the waies of our God, and follow his example.</p>

                  <head>In ſixe dayes the Lord created the heauen and earth.</head>
                  <p>IN this example which God hath propoſed, we may conſider ſomething of the power of God in the creation, and in that he ſpent no longer time then ſixe dayes in creating the whole world; we muſt vnderſtand by this doctrine, that God is able to bring to paſſe great matters in a ſhort time, and by ſmall meanes. The making of the world, one would think needed ſome good time for the thing it ſelfe, and ſome thing alſo, for the preparation of ſo long a building, but when God would be the workman, and take in hand ſo great a matter, what time tooke he to finiſh it? he began and ended it and all within the compaſſe of ſixe dayes, and left not the leaſt creature vnmade, till the ſeauenth; &amp; he tooke ſo long time, not becauſe he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch a ſpace, for he could haue done it with as much eaſe in an houre, yea, in a minute, as in theſe ſixe dayes, but he hath deuided the whole into ſixe dayes work, becauſe we might haue a fitter occaſion, and be better moued to conſider of euery one, for if he had folded vp altogether as it were in the compaſſe of an houre, then it had not bene ſo fit and eaſie for our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In this then we generally ſee what wonderfull works, &amp; great things God can bring to paſſe in a verie ſmall time, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29174:95"/> with very ſmall meanes, if the power of them bee judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to humane reaſon, <hi>for he ſpake,</hi> as the Pſal. ſaith, <hi>and it was done, he willed it, and without any more adoe it was effected.</hi> This we ſee likewiſe by other examples in ſcriptures, as <hi>Nebucadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> the mightie prince and monarch of the world, when he was walking in his princely pallace, in that great cittie of Babell, which was the ſeate of his kingdome, yet how quickly was ſtript from all, how ſoone depriued of his kingdome, ſo that he had not ſo much as an houſe, yea, a poore cottage to put his head into, nay, not one rag to couer his nakedneſſe, not a diſh to drink in, not a morſell of the courceſt bread to eate, but of a King became more miſerable then the baſeſt beggar vnder the Skye; yea, as miſerable as a beaſt: ſo that from the higheſt top of proſperitie, he was caſt downe to the extremitie of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. And then when he was at worſt, his wit and reaſon gon, his forme and beautie departed, and he a miſhapen creature, his haire being growne like Eagles feathers and his nayles like birds clawes, altogether deformed, not like a man now, and his kingdome poſſeſſed by an other, for ſeauen yeares ſpace; yet, ſo ſoone as he looked vp into heauen, his wit and diſcretion was reſtored, his beautie and faſhion renewed, and he plaſt in his kingdome, with as full power and authoritie as euer before.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe wonderfull alterations, in how little a time were they wrought, when God tooke in hand to work them. So in Aegipt, God tooke in hand to deliuer his people from cruell <hi>Pharaohs</hi> tyranny, what army had he, for that conqueſt, and who ſhould be the captaine? <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aron,</hi> two old men, the one eightie, the other eightie three, theſe muſt goe, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alone. But how were they furniſht againſt <hi>Pharaohs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and to take the Iſraelits perforce from his ſeruitude; <hi>Aron</hi> muſt haue nothing, but hee muſt ſpeake what <hi>Moſes</hi> bad him; And <hi>Moſes</hi> he muſt carry his ſhepherds ſtaffe; weake men, and weake meanes one would think, to make an encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon ſo great a King; If a carnall man had ſeene theſe two going againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and thinking to ſet the Iſraelites at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie perforce, whether he would or no, he would haue judged

But God taking in hand to work by theſe meanes, we ſee of what force and power that ſtaffe was, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> but held it vp, it brought ſuch plagues vpon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all Egipt, that all the kings in the world could not haue vexed and troubled him more with all their power; he neuer ſhooke his ſtaffe in vaine, but ſtill ſome notable plague followed, that deuoured the whole land. With this ſtaffe he ſtroke the waters, &amp; they were turned into bloud. He ſtroke the duſt with this ſtaffe, and it turned into lice; He held vp his ſtaffe towards heauen, there came graſſehoppers, flies, thunder, ſcabs, &amp; when he had made any of theſe wounds, he could cure them in as litte ſpace. One word vnto God by <hi>Moſes</hi> made all whole againe. So for our redemption, a poore maydens ſonne, that himſelfe ſeemed a poore baſe fellow of no reckoning or note, that had no wealth nor authoritie in the world, nay had not ſo much as an houſe to put his head in; hee muſt come &amp; be brought before a judge, &amp; ther be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, ſcourged, mocked, ſpitted on, crowned with thornes; at length muſt be carried and hanged vpon a croſſe, and beare the paines and anguiſh of Gods curſe in his ſoule on the croſſe, and by theſe meanes, God muſt be ſet at peace with man, a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was made, and all former ſinnes and jarres twixt God and man, put away. This greateſt work that was done, when heauen was purchaſed for man, ſinners made juſt before god, &amp; miſerable men of the earth, had the right of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall kingdome in heauen, beſtowed vpon them; all theſe things were brought to paſſe, and fully effected by theſe meanes, that to mans reaſon ſeemed of all things the moſt vnlikely to bring to paſſe, a matter of ſuch wonder and difficultie. And ſo at the reſurrection in the twinkling of an eye, what great chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhalbe, thoſe that lay in the duſt rotten, ſome thouſands of yeares, ſhalbe rayſed from their graue, made aliue, and to ſtand on their feet, and that bodie that was at the beſt before ſubject to death, to paine, and all miſerie, but now turned into earth,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29174:96"/> deuoured of wormes and corruption, and as it ſeemd, vaniſht to nothing, ſhalbe in a moment, if it be Gods childe, freed from mortalitie, from being ſubiect to diſeaſes, or any affliction, and ſhalbe made immortall and incorruptible, and like to Chriſt Ieſus, in glory. So wonderfull we ſee be the works of God, ſo mightie he is, and ſo full of power, that in the ſhorteſt time, &amp; by thoſe that ſeeme the weakeſt meanes, he can bring to paſſe the moſt ſtrange and glorious effects that can bee.</p>
                  <p>This then if we often meditate vpon it, will ſerue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the comfort of all thoſe children of God, whoſe caſe is ſo grieuous, intangled with ſuch perplexities, oppreſſed with ſuch ruines both of bodie and eſtate, as they think it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get out, and to be repayred againe, or if it might be, yet it will be a long time firſt. Oh but if we could beleeue Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie power, all things are poſsible to God, &amp; all things are poſsible to the beleeuer, it makes no matter what the diſeaſe be, ſo God be the Phiſition, it skils not what diſtreſſe a man be in, ſo God take in hand to help him, he can as ſoone and as eaſily cure the deadlieſt wound, as the lighteſt ſcarre, &amp; bring one out of the greateſt miſery with no meanes, as out of the leaſt miſerie with all meanes; Oh but I am poore, owe much, and haue nothing to pay it. No matter. So was the prophets wife, yet the little oyle in the cruſe held out to fill ſo many great emptie veſſells, that ſhe was reſtored &amp; made in a better eſtate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer before; it is not to the purpoſe, how weake the meanes be, and how great the ruins be, ſo the great and ſtrong God put to his hand to help. No man was euer more dejected then <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> from a King to be worſe then a beggar, from a pallace to the briars and buſhes; from princely robes, to plain nakedneſſe; from a man to a beaſt, from among men, to be among beaſts; and yet none in leſſe time and leſſe meanes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to an higher outward eſtate then he. And for the ſoule, ſo great ſinnes, ſuch hideous darkeneſſe in minde, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hart, ſuch peruerſeneſſe in will, ſuch diſorder and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in affections? and what of all theſe? how ſhall one get out of ſo many ſinnes? can one cry to God? can one lift vp his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:97"/> hart to heauen, though he cryed out of the bottome of the ſea, and out of the fiſhes belly with <hi>Ionas,</hi> God will heare him and let him ſee the Sunne; if hee were in the dungeon tyed with as many chaines, and burdened with as many ſinnes as he, yet God can and will, if he call in truth, bring him out of all, and ſet him in a better eſtate then euer he was before.</p>
                  <p>Theres not the leaſt ſinne or miſerie but would be to hard for vs, if we haue nothing but our owne ſtrength to help vs; there is not the greateſt ſinne nor the greateſt miſerie that ſhall hurt vs or preuaile ouer vs, if we haue the ſtrength and power of God to hold vs vp. Therefore chriſtians ſhould take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their afflictions. Can God rayſe vp his bodie when it is dead in the earth, and glorifie it when it is rotten in the graue, &amp; can he not raiſe him out of ſome debt or miſerie of his eſtate? Oh but then he loues the bodie? and doth he not loue it as well now? Then he will vſe his power, and is it curbed in, &amp; ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned now? Nay, God vſeth his infinite power now, for the help and preſeruation of his children, as he will vſe it then for their glorification. If we cannot beleeue God can help vs now, how will we ſay we can beleeue he will raiſe our rotten bodies out of the graue, ſith we haue the ſame power and promiſe for the one as the other. Therefore it is a great fault and ſhame for chriſtians to ſit down diſcouraged; why, is gods power leſſened? is his hand ſhortned? hath not he ſayd that a little that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous hath, is better then all the great riches of the wicked? Gods bleſsing can doe more then wealth, and he alone is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vs then if wee had all the world without him.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues likewiſe for the terror of the wicked men of the world, God can as eaſelie ſet heauen and earth on fire, and bring them to nothing, and in as little ſpace as hee made them of nothing: then much more can hee bring to deſtruction a baſe ſinner, notwithſtanding all his worldly helpes, if hee bee their aduerſarie, as hee is a profeſt enemie to all vnrepentant ſinners.</p>
                  <p>They flatter themſelues, and thinke it ſhall bee well with them, why? they bee vnderlaid with wealth, ſupported
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29174:97"/> with friendes, mounded and fenced with pollicie: but how ſtands the matter betwixt God and them, are they his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance or not? is hee reconciled vnto them or no? nay for that, though they will not in word ſay ſo, yet their life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes it, that they do not greatly reſpect his fauour, for they care not to break his law vpon any ſmall occaſion, ſurely then let them know that they are in no ſafetie, god can pull vp their defence, and pull away their props and ſupports, he can as eaſily bring a rich mans ſoule to hell, as a poore mans, and as ſoone damne the ſoule of the richeſt king, if hee bee naught, as of the baſeſt beggar.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe that leauing God leane to worldly props, ſhew that they litle beleeue the power of God, and little think of the creation of the world. Thus much for the example of God: now the laſt reaſon is drawne from the end of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, namely that God hath conſecrated it, to bring a bleſsing on the keepers of it, in theſe words.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeauenth day, and hallowed it.</head>
                  <p>HEere God ſhewes, that if none of the former reaſons will preuaile, yet wee ſhould bee moued for our owne benefit to regard it, for nothing is more auaileable to bring a bleſsing on ſoule &amp; bodie, then the religious keeping of the ſabboth, for God hath appointed it to the end that hee might haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to communicate his goodneſſe to the diligent obſeruers of it; So that from this reaſon that he ſaith God ſanctified the day, j. ſet it a-part for his vſe, and bleſſed it, that is, appointed it, for a meanes of bleſsing to the obedient, for the day it ſelfe is no more bleſſed then other daies.</p>
                  <p>From hence I ſay wee may learne that: the way to get all bleſsing, is to keepe holy the ſabboth; this is the moſt direct and ſure meanes to get all comfortable proſperitie, to keepe an holy reſt to God vpon his day. One reaſon is, becauſe God hath ſanctified it to this end, as for inward benefits is ſhewed. <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 56. 4. 7. Where the Lord ſhewes that for inward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:98"/> if any of what eſtate ſo euer, will keepe Gods ſabboth, hee ſhall haue his hart filled full of ſpirituall joy, God will giue him the ſpirit of praier, and heare his praiers, God will giue him abilitie to ſerue him, and accept and reward his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. 13. 14, If one will keepe himſelfe from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting Gods holy ſabboth, and keepe it carefullie, then he ſhall delight in the Lord, that is, God ſhall ſo ſhew his fauour and loue to his ſoule, as hee ſhall bee joyfull in God; ſo bleſſe his hart and conſcience as that he ſhall feele that God is his God, loues him and cares for him, ſo that hee ſhall exult and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, and finde Gods bleſsing both for heauen and for earth: ſo that the mouth of God hath ſpoken it, what euer fleſh and bloud will obiect, we haue the ſure promiſe of God, and it ſhall bee found true and faithfull. So for things of this life, <hi>Iere.</hi> 17. 24. The Prophet hauing foretold the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieruſalem, preſcribes a preſeruatiue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which if they would take, as yet their caſe was curable, and that would help all, namely to forbeare their worldly buſineſſe on the ſabboth, and ſo doe the works of the Lord, and then they ſhall enjoy their cittie, and their houſes, and their wealth, withal proſperitie and aboundance. So that we ſee for ſoule and bodie, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that the ſanctifying of the ſabboth, will bring happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and comfort to both.</p>
                  <p>The vſe then of this is, firſt for the terrifying of all ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both breakers, for if the keeping of a ſabboth, be the way to bleſsing, as the truth of God hath ſayd it, then on the contrary ſide the contempt and neglect of it, leades to all curſes and wretchedneſſe; For God hath ſhewed that this will kindle a fire vpon their houſes; but they hope to quench it? no, they ſhall not, it cannot be quenched, one may as well quench hell fire as the fire of Gods curſe, in this life, if they continue ſtill in this ſinne. And in truth experience ſhewes it, that there is a wild fire moſt continually ſet vpon ſuch mens goods that they come to naught, and if they get mony, yet they put it in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bag, the canker of Gods vengeance eates all vp, and they come to neede and want, where ſhall one finde one in twentie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29174:98"/> that be common ſabboth breakers, as carriers, and ſuch like, but they come to miſery, or if they doe thriue in the world and whord vp outward riches, the curſe of God ſeiſes more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their ſoules, and this is the greateſt plague of all, for now it ſhewes that God hath no purpoſe to doe them good, for thoſe whom hee loues he corrects, and this is the ſoreſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie that can bee for a ſinner to thriue in his ſinne, this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens his hart, and makes him runne with full courſe to hell, as no ſuch men is ſeene, they be the moſt wicked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered perſons that can bee, they profit nothing by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods word, hearing worketh not in them, they haue no affection in prayer, but euen as dead ſtones; no ſpirituall thing can worke vpon them for their good, but euerie wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worldly thing, hath ſtrength and power enough to worke on them, for their greater hurt. So that in truth, God ſhewes how hee likes of their courſe, and this ſhould terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them from this ſo daungerous and miſerable a courſe of liuing.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, ſith God doth promiſe a bleſsing vpon thoſe that ſanctifie his ſabboth, that they ſhall thriue in the Lords houſe, and in religion, and in other worldlie matters, ſo farre as may ſtand with true proſperitie, ſith he hath ſpoken this, &amp; that muſt ſtand which goes out of his mouth, therefore it is for their comfort, that the bleſsing of God ſhall attend vpon them whether they haue little or much; If they haue abundance, the abundance ſhall bee for their good, to be more abundant in good; and if they haue but from hand to mouth, God will ſo prouide, that yet they ſhall not want neceſſarie things, but he that brings the day, will bring foode and maintainance for the daie, ſo that he neede not care for to morrow, but caſt his care vpon God, whoſe truth it concernes to care for him: and this they are ſure off, they ſhall haue a ſoft hart, and a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſhall receiue comfort from Gods promiſes, and if one thriue in Gods houſe, he neede not care carkinglie and diſtruſtfullie, how he ſhall doe in his owne houſe. One may know how he ſhall ſpeede at home, by looking how hee ſerues
<pb facs="tcp:29174:99"/> God in the Church. If hee keepe an holie reſt, with an holie hart, holylie, he ſhall haue reſt to his ſoule, peace &amp; joy to his conſcience, and bee ſet in ſo ſure an outward eſtate, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall befall him for his hurt.</p>
                  <p>But then if one will haue this bleſsing, he muſt keepe theſe three rules. Firſt, let him make it a delight to keepe the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and his joy to doe the workes of the ſabboth, let him long for it before it comes, and bee glad of it when it comes, becauſe it frees him from all worldlie cares and thoughts, and then hee hath a commandement more eſpeciallie, to caſt his care vpon God, and not to trouble himſelfe a whit with them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo he ſaith in Iſay, <hi>call it a delight to conſecrate it to the Lord, take as much pleaſure in doing the exerciſes of religion, as the workes of your calling.</hi> And more to, indeede; for they bee more eaſie and comfortable by farre: wee muſt come as hungrie to the houſe of God, and with as good an appetit, as to our dinner or ſupper at home, for in deede God keepes the beſt houſe, hee makes the beſt cheere, if wee can bring a good ſtomacke to the bread of life, that hee breaketh vnto vs. But if one bee loth to come, and muſt be drawne as a beare to the ſtake, let him make account that the preacher will bait him, &amp; trouble his conſcience, for comfort hee can looke for none; Therfore if we would haue a bleſsing by the ſabboth, let vs keepe it cherfullie, knowing that God loues a cherfull giuer.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, one muſt labour to doe all the duties of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, thoſe that muſt bee done before the ſermon, and thoſe that muſt be done after; let no ordinance ſcape vndone, vſe meditation on Gods word and works, heareing, reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinging pſalmes, conference, workes of mercie, &amp; of euerie thing, ſomething, ſo farre as we haue abilitie and opportunitie. But if we will performe them ſcambling lie, doe this, and leaue that, vndone; either make no preparation before, or no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication after, either no publique; or no priuate, then it may bee, he ſhall finde ſome bleſsings, but the fewer of theſe hee performeth, the fewer bleſsings he ſhall haue; he that doth the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29174:99"/> work of God by halfes, ſhall (and it is juſt he ſhould) find the comfort and benefit of them by halfes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, as one muſt doe all the duties, and that with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light cherfullie, ſo he muſt keepe the whole day; he muſt doe all the duties and alſo ſpend all the time in theſe duties; hee muſt continue from the beginning to the ending. As in Pſal. 92. 2. <hi>To declare Gods louing kindneſſe in the morning, and his truth at night.</hi> So that the ſabboth muſt bee ſpent both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, night and all the daie, in holie duties. One muſt forbeare worldlie buſineſſe; yea, worldlie thoughts, the whole foure &amp; and twentie houres, for if one giue his thoughts libertie to run after matters of the world in the night, he breakes the ſabboth in one part; ſleepe one may lawfullie, but his ſleepe muſt bee ſweetned with holie exerciſes, and ſo ſanctified vnto him, as in it hee muſt alſo keepe an holie reſt. And heere manie faile, that out of the Church wilbe talking with their neighbours, &amp; muſing with themſelues about earthlie buſineſſes &amp; affaires, &amp; thinke they haue made a good hand if they ſpend the moſt part of the daie till after the euening exerciſes in workes of religion, and then they make no queſtion to take their recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or to goe about their buſineſſes if occation bee. But hee that commands to keepe it in the church, bids vs keepe it in the houſe, as to heare him, and ſpeake to him in publique, ſo to ſpeake to him out of our harts in priuate, &amp; not to giue our ſelues leaue to thinke, the leaſt thought of any worldlie buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now then wee if ſeeme to make conſcience of the ſabboth, and yet doe want that bleſsing which we doe looke for, let vs looke to our ſelues, &amp; we ſhall ſee that wee are halting in ſome one of theſe, either wee keepe the ſabboth lumpiſhlie and heauilie, that it ſeemes as a tedious burden vnto vs, or elſe wee doe ſome one or two duties, &amp; leaue the reſt vndone; or elſe if we doe all the duties to be done, we want heere that we obſerue not the whole day, but keep ſome part of it from god, to our ſelues, &amp; accordinglie as any man comes ſhort in any of
<pb facs="tcp:29174:100"/> theſe duties, ſo hee commeth ſhort of the fruit of the ſabboth; But if one labour with joy, to doe all the duties of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, the whole day, hee ſhall finde in his owne ſoule, that it is in truth a day of bleſsing, and brings more joy and comfort, yea, and a greater bleſsing with it, then all the weeke beſides. And ſo much for this fourth commandement of the ſabboth, and the reaſons of it.</p>

For all diſorders in the other commandements of the ſecond Table doe flow from hence; that eyther ſuperiours are negligent in performing their dutie of gouerning, or elſe inferiours are proud and ſtubborne, and refuſe to obey their ſuperiours.

The commaundement in thoſe words: <hi>Honour thy father and mother.</hi> The reaſon in the words following: <hi>That thy daies may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi> Becauſe the benefit of obedience is not ſo great to the ſuperiours, which are obeyed, as to him that doth for conſcience ſake obey them; they ſhall not be gainers ſo much as himſelfe, for he ſhall gaine to himſelfe a long and happie life.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29174:101"/> them for this cauſe, and in obedience to Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, howſoeuer they be otherwiſe froward and fooliſh, if they be yours, then you muſt performe your duetie vnto them. So for ſeruants, the poynt is not whether hee bee a poore man or rich, a ſimple man and ignorant, or wiſe and diſcreete, but is he a maſter? hath God made him a gouernour? then for the time that one is a ſeruant, he ſtands in the place of Chriſt in his family, and is to be obeyed, as if hee were the moſt honourable and wiſe in the world.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this is to conſute thoſe wretched and miſerable chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that take occaſion to be vndutifull, becauſe their parents be poore and low, and in diſgrace and ſmall account among men. But be they ſo? then the childe ought ſo much the more to honour them, or elſe he addes afflication to afflication. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo farre ſhould he be from contemning his parents, becauſe they be low and afflicted, as that he ſhould reuerence them, and honour them the more, that he may be a comfort and reliefe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their trouble.</p>
                  <p>For, for the child to honour his parents, when all the world ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours them, and hath them in account, and to be dutifull then when they can eyther reward him if he be dutifull, or puniſh him for his vndutifulneſſe; is no triall of his honeſtie and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God: For then it may be he doth it ether vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, becauſe he dare do no otherwiſe, or of a baſe minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loues and gapes after his fathers wealth, more then for conſcience to Gods commaundement. But then the obedience is moſt ſound and acceptable to God, when there be feweſt worldly meanes to prouoke one vnto it. So for the wife or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to ſay, O had I an husband or maſter of ſuch great account, of ſuch gifts and wiſedome that could promote and reward me; then I could frame to obedience. Nay, for he that is not faithfull in the leaſt will not be faithfull in the moſt. And God accounts not of that obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce, or reuerence which proceeds not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſcience of his commandement, but from hope of ſome outward reward.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is our dutie not ſo much to trouble our ſelues in enquiring what heads other haue, as to labour to make beſt of
<pb facs="tcp:29174:102"/> our owne. For this in the naturall bodie we ſee, that if one haue an head full of infirmities, and ſubiect to diſeaſes, he will not therefore knocke it againſt the walles, and contemne it: but he thinks; this is my head that God hath giuen me, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt not make it worſe by ill vſage, but ſtriue to make it better by all means I can. O but ſay they, other children haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parents that be more carefull of them. But let ſuch turne backe a little, and looke to themſelues, and examine their owne ſtuffe; other, you ſay haue better parents; true. But looke to your ſelfe a little, and thinke on the other ſide, haue not other parents alſo better children, more duetifull and obedient, and more vertuous euerie way then you be? Put theſe two together now, and then the mouth will ſoone be ſtopped. So the wife; other husbandes are more kinde and louing, and be better to their wiues.</p>
                  <p>But if you ſtand ſo much in examining his goodneſſe by other mens, you will driue him to trie your goodneſſe with other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Be not there many wiues, more ſubiect to their husbands, more quiet and meeke, and that goe farre beyond your ſelfe in many graces? So that in ſuch obiections, let inferiours couch theſe two one with the other, and looke to their owne faults as well as to anothers, and they ſhall not finde great cauſe to complayne. O but he ſayles in doing his dutie to me: but God failes not in commaunding you to doe your duetie to him. This is the point, be you a Chriſtian or an hypocrite? If you bee a Chriſtian, then GODS commaundement muſt be the rule of your obedience, and not the dealing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to you. Therefore this doth iuſtly reprooue their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious boldneſſe and ſhameleſſe impudence, that if their parents growe olde, or impotent or poore; then they thinke they may take libertie to caff of the yoake of ſubiection, and to grow ſtubborne; as who ſhould ſay, that age and pouertie of ſuch like things, could cut of the nature of a parent, and take away the authoritie of a ſuperiour, &amp; that outward things ſhould haue the chiefe account, and Gods commaundement be leaſt of all regarded.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29174:102"/>
                  <p>This likewiſe may ſerue for ſome comfort to theſe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, that are in a poorer or lower condition; that God hath challenged vnto them as much honour in their place as to the greateſt prince in the world. For the poore mans wife is as much bound by God to honour her husband, as the Queene to honour the king. And the meaneſt parents and maiſters are as much to be acounted of in their families, as if they had all the welth and honour in the world. Therefore they ſhould beare their pouertie ſo much the more patiently, Becauſe no pouertie or lowneſſe of their eſtate, can giue licence to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours to account anie whit the worſe of them; and if the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours doe for this cauſe deſpiſe them, they ſinne againſt God, doe iniurie vnto them, and GOD will be reuenged of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>So much for that, God bids the inferiour to honour his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, And the child his father, howſoeuer matters ſtand in other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honour.</hi> The duties of the naturall childe commanded in this word, are comprehended vnder theſe three heades. Firſt, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Secondly, obedience. Thirdly, thankefulneſſe. for the firſt. For reuerence. Children are commaunded to reuerence their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Now this reuerence muſt be both inward and outward; In the heart, and behauiour of the bodie. For if the outwarde begin not at the heart it is hypoctiticall, and therefore not pleaſing to God. And if one pretende the inward reuerence and ſhew it not outwardly, this is but diſſembling and falſehood; for it cannot be within, but it will ſhew it ſelfe without. So that it muſt be both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heart and outward in cariage of ones bodie. The inward is commanded. <hi>Leuit. 9. 19. 3. Yee ſhall feare euerie man his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother and keepe my Sabboths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In thoſe words GOD commandes the ſubſtance of the whole lawe, both in the firſt and ſecond table, and for the ſecond table he begins with the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>Feare euery man his mo ther.</hi> One would haue thought he ſhould haue begun with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but though more be due vnto him yet becauſe it is a greater not of truth to performe it to the mother, becauſe her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:29174:103"/> whereto ſhee is more ſubiect, make her more ſubiect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and for her indulgencie, commonlie the mother doth leſſe exact this at her childs hand, therefore God doth beginne there where obedience is beſt tried, and faith, <hi>Feare thy Mother and thy father.</hi> and then for the firſt table he ſets downe the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of it. Keepe my ſabboths, and whoſoeuer is carefull in the firſt table conſcionablie to keepe the ſabboth, and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to keepe the fifth commandement in dutie to ſuperiours, he ſhall be ſure to holde out in all the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements; ſo that reuerence of the heart is required of children. The ſecond branch of reuerence is in the outward behauiour; as in bowing to them, in ſtanding bare and putting of before them, in an humble and lowly countenance and behauiour when one ſpeakes vnto them. And this the example of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhewes. <hi>Geneſis. 48.</hi> He was a great Prince and his father but a poore man, and liued at his finding, he had his ſight and his father for age was blinde, and therefore could not ſee his dutie, yet when he comes to his poore father and his blind father, he bowes to the ground, and behaues himſelfe ſo lolily as if his father had beene a mightie man, and had his ſight as perfectly as euer in his life. Becauſe he knew that neither blindneſſe nor pouertie coulde take a way the nature of a father nor the dutie of a ſonne. Therefore he being a prince is as duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his father a poore man, as if his father had beene a Prince &amp; he poore, for the outward eſtate did not moue him ſo much as the conſcience and regard of his dutie which he knew to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſened. So king <hi>Solomon</hi> when his mother came vnto him ſitting on his throane, it is noted that hee roſe vp from hsi throane, and bowed himſelfe vnto her; and cauſed all things els to ceaſe, till he had ſet his olde mother in a place of honour fit for her.</p>
                  <p>And he would haue all his people to know that though hee was as wiſe and rich a king, and that of Gods owne appointing as euer was; yet this his greatneſſe did nothing diminiſh his mothers ſuperioritie, nor his reuerent cariadge towardes her.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues to confute thoſe vngrations and wretched children
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29174:103"/> that doe not reuerence their parents in heart but, contemne them, and thinke baſely of them; and content not themſelues with this inward vndutifulneſſe, but ſhew it alſo by rough wordes, by fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward countenance by vnreuerent and vnfit actions. and manie grow ſo familiar with their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as that one that had not known them, ſeeing their behauiour, would rather thinke them to bee neighbour and neighbour then father and ſonne; ſo vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vndutifullie do they behaue themſelues without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens of reuerence. And indeed what doth the froward ſpeaches and lookes of manie children proclaime, but that they haue no feare of God in their hearts, no righteouſneſſe in their hands, nor anie regard of the duties of the firſt or ſecond table? If euer theſe perſons liue to haue children and God doe not in his iuſtice cutte them of, they ſhall finde, that their children will reuenge their fathers wrongs into their boſome, and be as readie to deſpiſe them, and carrie themſelues vnreuerently to them, as if they were to doe it to their parents.</p>
                  <p>The next dutie is obedience. which is commanded. <hi>Coloſſ. 3, Children obey your parents;</hi> and he adds a reaſon, <hi>this is pleaſing to God.</hi> It is not only a pleaſing and a ioyfull thing to the parents that the childe ſhould obey his comandements; But this is a thing that God takes greate delight in, and is well pleaſed with all, and on the contrarie it doth not only greiue and offende the parents that children be ſtubborne and rebellious, but it offendeth Gods maieſtie alſo and greeueth his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Now the thinges where in children muſt obey their parents, are eſpeciallie theſe. Firſt in doing the thinges that they command, and performing that worke that there parents ſet them about; that it be neuer ſo baſe and painefull to doe, ſo far as their ſtrength will permit. For though ſome children may thinke; why, this worke is to baſe and vnbeſeeming my worth, (for as euerie one is more proud &amp; idle, ſo he hath a greater conceite of himſelfe, and as he is moſt baſe and contemptible, ſo hath he a higher imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne excellencie and worth,) though they may thinke the workes too baſe, yet that may not excuſe. Is it too baſe? I; but did your father comand it, and reſraine you doe it? Then you
<pb facs="tcp:29174:104"/> are a baſe and proud perſon, that make no more account of your owne fleſh then of Gods commandement; for ſo ſoone as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded it being a lawful thing, Gods ſtampe is ſet on it, &amp; it caries the face of Gods commandement, &amp; he that thinkes himſelfe to good to doe it, thinkes himſelfe too good to obey God. This will not ſerue the turne then, it is a contemptible thing in the world and men will mocke me; why but are you a chriſtian and haue you not learned ſo farre to denie the world, as to preferre Gods commandement before the contentment and mocking of men? and were it not better for you that the worlde ſhould ſpeake euill of you vniuſtly, for well doing. Then that god ſhould inſtly plague you for well doing? An example of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience we haue in <hi>Iſaac</hi> who yeelded to his fathers commade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo far as to ſuffer his head to be chopt of, and himſelfe bound and laid one the woode and burnt. Becauſe his father being a Prophet had warrant ſo to doe, and could ſhew the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vnto him, to proue it a lawfull thing he did, and twas his dutie to obey.</p>
                  <p>If he had not ſeene Gods commandement, <hi>Abraham</hi> had gon beyonde his commiſſion; for it had beene willfull murder, and he ought not to haue obeyed but when the thing was lawfull, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was bounde to ſubmit himſelfe to his father euen vnto death. So Chriſt was obedient to his father in the moſt baſe and painfull thinge of all, for what burden more contemptible then the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of our ſinnes, and to be hanged on the croſſe, mockt, and ſpitted on and buffetted? and what more painfull, then to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the curſe and plague of God? yet if he his father would haue him ſuffer all this, he would not ſtand with him for ſuch a mattter but willingly ſubmitted himſelfe to the death of the croſſe. So that if the thing be lawfull, though it be a thing of no credit and of much paine, yet if it be the fathers commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is Gods commandement and, the child muſt obey; and by how much the thing is more baſe and contemptible, and more hard and painfull; by ſo much he is a better childe and ſhall haue a greater reward, for in matters that be eaſie and pleaſing, hee doth ſerue himſelfe; now a good child ſhould ſerue his father; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29174:104"/> euery chriſtian childe muſt be his fathers ſeruant, but hee that is vndutifull and ſtub borne is a rebell againſt God. And as in other matters the parents are to be obeyed, ſo eſpeically in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> being a man of diſcretion of 40. yeares old, yet would not once goe about to take a wife for himſelfe, but was content to ſtand at his fathers choſing. And <hi>Iacob</hi> would not diſpoſe of himſelfe in mariage till <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted vpon the matter, and had directed him whether hee ſhould, and among whom he ſhould choſe his wife. <hi>Naomi</hi> being but a daughter in law, yet would not be at her owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to take what husband liked her beſt, but was willing to be diſpoſed by <hi>Naomi</hi> in matter of mariage eſpecially. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore children muſt giue this honour to their parents, to thinke their fathers wiſer and better able, to make choyce themſelues, and as in matters leſſe weightie, ſo eſpecially to take their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and be directed by them in this great matter that ſo neerely concerns their eſtate.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thinge wherein children muſt obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is in bearing their admonitions and corrections. As it is often ſaid in the <hi>prouerbs. Deſpiſe not the correction of thy father nor contemne not the admonition of thy mother. Set not light by them, but weigh them and conſider well of them in thine heart.</hi> Nowe the childe is bound to obey his father, as in doing the thinges commanded, ſo in ſuffering his rebukes and chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Becauſe it is a dutie lying vpon the ſoule of the father and commanded vnto him from God; and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a teſtimonie of his fathers loue to him, for hee that ſpareth the rod hates the childe; but he that loues him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects him betime. And then correction is a meanes of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and keepes them from hell, for fooliſhneſſe is bound to the heart of the childe, it is tyed there as with a corde or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chayned; ſo that nothing will make a ſeperation but the rod of correction, that will part them, and he that is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, is a foole and ſo ſhall continue ſtill. Becauſe then it is the fathers dutie, and a token of his loue and a meanes of the good of the childe, he muſt ſuffer it patiently and humbly, and
<pb facs="tcp:29174:105"/> not only ſo, but hee muſt ſee that hee profit by it, and make a good vſe of it; for elſe he makes his father take much paines and vndergoe a great deale of greeſe in vaine, and to no purpoſe; and therefore not profiting by correction is guiltie of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods ordinance. This ſerues for the reproofe of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as are ſoure and angrie at the admonition or correction of their parents, that although they be fonde and light headed, and haue neither experience nor knowledg, yet thinke they can tell how to carrie themſelues well enough, and ſcorne to bee admoniſhed or told of a fault. but of ſuch that is verified that the wiſe men faith, <hi>afoole is wiſer in his owne conceite then ten men that render a reaſon.</hi> But for theſe parſons that pout and ſwell thus at an admonition, the beſt courſe that can be taken with the is, to beat out that pride by ſharpe correction. For this makes them ſo audacious when wordes are giuen vnto them, becauſe they haue not beene ſoundly and throughly corrected.</p>
                  <p>The third dutie of Children is thankefulneſſe to their parents and conſiſteth eſpecially in two things. Firſt, in releiuing their parents, when they ſhall be in want; if the parent be blinde the child muſt be an eye vnto him; if he be lame he muſt be a ſtaffe vnto him, if he ſtand in neede of any thing, the childe muſt to his power helpe, and ſuccour him. And this dutie indeed the verie law of nature doth require, for the father hath paide for it before hand, and it is but a due debt; for when the child was borne naked without any friends and could not helpe himſelfe nor put one morſell of meate into his owne mouth, nor hang a ragge on his own bodie to keepe him warme, who pittied him, who releiued him? were not the parents then inſteede of all limmes vnto him: and had much care and feare for his ſake, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to this eſtate wherein he is now? were it not then a ſhamefull ingratitude in him? and were he not worſe then a beaſt, if he would not haue care to recompence all theſe kindneſſes and to pay ſo due a debt? So the holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands children. <hi>To be like the ſtroke.</hi> Now the manner of the ſtroke is this, that when the olde one is growne weake and cannot flye a broade for himſelfe, the young ſtorkes will helpe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29174:105"/> him, and the old ſtroke fares as well, &amp; is as largly prouided for by the trauaile of the young, as when he was in his full and perfect ſtrength. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> dealt with <hi>Iacob,</hi> when <hi>Iacob</hi> was in want and his ſonne had plentie; when his father ſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to buy corne the ſonne would not take it but gaue him corne freely, and whereas ſiue yeares of famine were behinde, he ſent for him, and had great care to bring him thether, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brought him thether, was ſo carefull to prouide for him, and to adminiſter to him whatſoeuer hee had neede of, as that <hi>Iacob</hi> did neuer fare better and with more eaſe in all the time of greateſt plentie, then he did, when the whole world, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famiſhed for want of bread. for before he ſent to the market for it, and there he muſt buy it for his money, but now, that he was come to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in dearth, he needes not be at ſo great paines or coſt, for it is ſayd, <hi>He did put meat into his mouth;</hi> that is, he was a good te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der hearted nurce to his father, and his fathers familie, and as carefull that nothing ſhould be lacking to them as the mother for the childe, that will euen put her teat into the childs mouth. So <hi>Ruth</hi> though ſhe was but <hi>Naomies</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law, yet now that <hi>Naomies</hi> yeares and ſtrenght were; ſpent, ſhee being young tooke paines and trauelled for both; and when beſide that which ſhee had gotten with her paine and labour <hi>Boaz</hi> being a mercifull man, gaue her ſome victuals, ſhee would not deuoure all her ſelfe, but euen ſpared it from her owne bellie for her mother; only ſhee tooke ſo much as was needfull to refreſh her bodie, and to ſtrengthen her in her trauaile, the reſt ſhee reſerued for her old mother in law, and knew well that it was better young folkes ſhould bee pinched, then their old parents lacke anything. Therefore we ſee how God honoured her with the mariage of a Prince and great man in Iſraell, and gaue the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus to be borne of her ſeede.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues for the ſharpe reproofe of the ſwiniſh, and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition of many vngratious children, that ſo long as the parents haue anie thing to giue, and ſomething may be be gotten by them, all that while they will be ſo kinde, and
<pb facs="tcp:29174:106"/> ſo louing, and there is ſuch ſtriuing and catching, that well is he that can get the old one; but when their parents are drawne drie and they haue ſucked all from him, and left nothing once, then he is neglected of all, then euerie day is an yeare till he be deade, then he is a burden and a clogge, and he muſt be eating and drinking, then he doth nothing but ſpende, he gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſuch foule and curriſh ſpeaches ſhalbe hearde oft times from the mouthes of wicked and vnnaturall children. This is the fowleſt diſhonour that can be, not to releeue and helpe the weake and diſtreſſed parents. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> faith, <hi>Matt. 15. 6. ſuch honour not their parents,</hi> thoſe that pretende by beſtowing it an other way to bee freed from releeuing their parents, theſe doe not honour there parents. And for theſe churliſh and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people let them looke for it, if God caſt them not into hell before, their children ſhall make euen with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and quitte there parents wronges to the full, by the like fauage dealing with them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond dutie of thankefulneſſe is to pray for their parents. As in <hi>Tim. 2.</hi> He commands that <hi>prayers be made for all in authoritie,</hi> And if any muſt praye for thoſe that be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of in common weale, much more for thoſe that are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the familie. Therefore this is a fault to bee greatly condemned in many, that can ſee their parents faults and ſpeake of them too much, but cannot finde time to fall downe before God, and beſeech him to heale their nature and helpe them out of their ſinnes. Many haue liued a longe time with their parents yet cannot ſay that they ſent vp an heartie prayer to heauen for their parents, ſo vnnaturall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull be they.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of all theſe duties to thoſe whoſe parents are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, is to looke that their ſinnes be not aliue after their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents death. And therefore to examine themſelues, whether they haue beene faultie in any of theſe things, and if they do repent for it, and deſire pardon, elſe they be lyable to two plagues. Firſt that their children ſhould take their parents quarrell in hand, and requite their wicked dealing in what euer dutie they haue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29174:106"/> fayled, and haue not repented of it. And ſecondly, that as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring parents, brings a long and happie life; ſo their diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring their parents ſhould make them haue a ſhort life and miſerable, or if a long life, yet full of Gods curſes for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented ſonne. Therfore let ſuch as be now fatherleſſe, marke themſelues, and finding that their children are ſtubborne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and vnthankfull and rebellions euerie way, as many may ſee it openly and wofully, let call themſelues backe, and ſee what kinde of children they were before, how they behaued themſelues to their parents, whether they were not all together faultie in this point. If it be ſo, let them confeſle that their owne ſinnes haue found them out, and are turned open, let them acknowledge that God is iuſt, and hath giuen the ſame meaſure into their boſomes; their own euill is fallen vpon their owne heads, they digged a pit in their youth, and now in their age are fallen into it. And thus much of the duties of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Now follow the duties of parents to their children. For vnder the dutie of inferiour is comprehended alſo the dutie of the ſuperiour. And as God would haue inferiours to giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo he commaunds ſuperiours to carrie themſelues in that manner that they may deſerue honour. And doth bind them as ſtraightly as the inferiours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the duties of parents, to their children are eyther in their tender yeares. riper age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parents dutie to the children in their tender yeares and childhood, is firſt to inſtruct them in religion, to ſeaſon them with the words of pietie, or by little and little to drop in the grounds of holineſſe into them, euen ſo ſoone as they are able to ſpeake and beginne to haue the leaſt vſe of vnderſtanding. So <hi>Prouerb. Teach a childe in the trade of his youth, and he will remember it afterwards.</hi> Where the holy ghoſt exhorting men to teach their young children meetes with an obiection. Alaſſe might one ſay, teach ſuch little ones? what good will
<pb facs="tcp:29174:107"/> that doe? we ſhall but looſe our labour, for they cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, nor conceiue the meaning of theſe things. The holy ghoſt anſweres. Be it, that for the time he cannot vnderſtand the ſenſe, yet teach him the words and tearmes of goodneſſe, and though while he continues a child, perhaps it ſeeme a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thing; yet you ſhall ſee afterwards it will not be in vaine; for the crop of this ſeede, that was ſoone in the childhood, will appeare when he comes to age, though for a time it lay hidden, &amp; then he wil remember theſe things, &amp; that to good vſe, which it ſeemed he got no good by when he was ſo young, &amp; wanting vnderſtanding. Therefore let him haue the words taught him when he is able to heare and ſpeake words, and after when he is of more diſcretion, he will conceiue &amp; remember the ſenſe too. And this dutie the holy ghoſt commaunds. <hi>Epheſ. 6. 4. Bring them up in inſtruction and feare of the Lord.</hi> And this <hi>Timothies</hi> mother did put in practiſe.</p>
                  <p>For it is noted of her that ſhe inſtructed <hi>Timothie</hi> in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from a child, and that was the cauſe he was ſo holy a man, ſhe was a nurſe to his ſoule as wel as to his bodie, and gaue him milke out of the breaſts of the ſcripture, ſo ſoone as he had done ſucking her owne breaſts, ſo that as he waxed ſtrong in naturall ſtrength of naturall life, ſo he waxed ſtrong in the knowledge of the life to come, and therefore he grew ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a man, and ſo worthy a preacher and member of the Church, becauſe his mother fedde his ſoule as well as his bodie.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of parents to their children in their yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yeares, is to correct them, to giue them correction, which the holy ghoſt in the <hi>Prouerbs</hi> commaunds often, and ſhews the fruit of it: <hi>Correct him and thou ſhalt ſaue his ſoule, chaſten him, and he will giue thee pleaſure.</hi> In the latter, the rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection driues away folly, this is the onely meanes to make a diuorſe betwixt foliſhneſſe and his heart, which are ſo neerely wedded together. But in correction theſe rules muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let it be ſeaſonable and done in time, paſſe it not ouer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29174:107"/> to long, but begin early enough. So <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>Hee that loues him corrects him be time, and doth not omit it till it be to late, but takes the fitteſt opportunitie, when he may with moſt eaſe and feweſt ſtripes doe moſt good.</hi> For indeed a ſmall twig, and a fewe blowes in time when he is yet a child, &amp; not hardened in ſinne, will doe more good, then many tods and abundance of ſtripes, afterwards if this ſeaſo be let ſlip: for if the child be not maſtred when he is young, he will maiſter his parents when he growes elder. Therefore let them not get an head, for if they doe, they will prooue like an young colt that hath gotten an ill tricke at the firſt, &amp; he hath once caſt his rider; he was marred in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and now you may ſooner almoſt kill him, then breake him, and bring him in any good order againe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt be done with great compaſſion and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, not in bitterneſſe to eaſe ones ſelfe with the paine of the child, which is too barbarous crueltie. For in truth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is good cauſe why the father ſhould be as much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or rather more then the child, becauſe for the moſt part he doth but correct his owne ſinnes in his ſonne; for if the childe be curſt and froward, is it not becauſe he hath ſeene the parents brawling and contentious? if he lye, hath not his father giuen him a patterne of diſſembling, and if he ſweare being young, are not oathes too reefe in the familie among elder folkes? if he rayle and ſpeake euill, was not his parents dealing a preſident to him? Lightly, there be but few ill humors in the child, which he did not draw from the parents, and that ill ſappe which doth appeare in the bud came firſt from the roote. Therefore in pitie, as ſmiting at themſelues and their owne ſinnes, they muſt giue chaſticements to their children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it muſt be done with prayer, that God will giue them wiſe hearts, to giue moſt due and ſeaſonable correction, and their children alſo ſoft hearts, to receiue it with patience, and to their profit. Be it, that the child doe well deſerue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio, yet to flie vpon him in a paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this is too beaſtly a rage. for a cow will not ruſh vpon her calſe in furie, nor a ſheepe will not deale ſo with her lambe, and indeed this doth but harden
<pb facs="tcp:29174:108"/> the childs heart, and imbitter him, and make him more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and fearce, and miſchieuous. Therefore that one may correct his child for ſome good end, it muſt be done with prayer, and ſo it ſhall be done alſo with great calmeneſſe and meekenes, and without mixture of wrath and paſſion. For if the word and Sacrament, be vnprofitable without Gods bleſſing, which why ſhould he giue, if one thinke too much to aske it? much leſſe may one looke for eyther bleſſing or profit by the rod, vnleſſe he aske it of God. But being ioyned with prayer, becauſe it is Gods ordinance, God will giue a bleſſing and it ſhall doe good.</p>
                  <p>A thirde dutie to be performed in infancie, (eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes vnto the mother, the former were common to both parents, but this is her ſpeciall dutie) to nurce it. Not to throw it from her ſo ſoone as ſhee hath brought it into the world, but as God hath giuen her, as her wombe to beare, ſo breaſts and milke to nouriſh her child; ſo let her be thankfull to God for the bleſſing, and vſe them to that end that he gaue them. For this is ſo naturall, that euen the beaſts will not omit it, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and leaneſt beaſts that is, yet will ſuckle her young ones her ſelfe, and will not be ſo vnnaturall, as to poſt them ouer to another. And this is noted of the good women in ſcripture that they did much reioyce in ſuckling their children with their owne breaſts, as <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaith, <hi>that now ſhe ſhall giue ſueke,</hi> a thing that greatly gladded her heart. And it is noted as a plague and puniſhment to haue a barren wombe and drie breaſts, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is foule fault when God hath giuen a good bleſſing for one wilfully to turn into a curſe. Thoſe women therfore that haue failed in this dutie, muſt be humbled as hauing omitted a good duty, that god required at their hands, &amp; thoſe that haue done it, muſt do it ſtill. For in the primitiue Church, when widows were to be choſen that ſhould haue the ſicke and weake ſeruants committed to their charge and tending, none were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this office but thoſe that had nourced their children themſelues; though they were otherwiſe good women and vertuous, yet if they had not beene ſo mercifull to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29174:108"/> there was a ſuſpicion left, that (howſoeuer God would change and alter their hearts) if they were vnnaturall to thoſe, that were ſo neare to them, ye would be negligent to thoſe that were further of them; and therefore they were not to be truſted with this office. So much for the duties which parents muſt performe to their children in their tender yeares. Now thoſe follow which muſt be performed when they grow to more ripenes of yeares.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are firſt, To bring them vp in ſome profitable and lawfull calling, by which they may liue honeſtly and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly, and not be fruitlles burdens of the earth, and clogs to their friends, drones that muſt liue on other mens ſweat, and can do nothing themſelues, but that they be trayned vp in ſome honeſt occaſion, whereby they may be able to maintayne themſelues, and doe ſome good to others. So <hi>Adam</hi> did, though he was rich enough, and had large poſſeſſions to leaue to his ſonnes. For they had the whole world to be deuided amongſt them, that was patrimonie ſufficient, yea he would not let his ſonnes ſpend their time idely, &amp; liue like idle fellowes hauing nothing to doe, but brought vp the one in husbandrie, and the other in keeping ſheepe, probable and lawfull vocations. The like is ſeene in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was a great man, and of ſuch great wealth, as that <hi>Abimelech</hi> the king confeſſeth he was greater and mightier then he. Notwithſtanding all this greatneſſe, <hi>Iacobs</hi> bringing vp was not in idleneſſe and ſloth, but he was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in husbandrie, and had verie good skill in handling cattle, and had it not beene for this, what would he haue done when perſecution came, when he was faine to leaue his fathers, if he had done nothing before, and could haue done nothing now, but eate and drinke and ſleepe, who would haue giuen him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and where ſhould he haue had maintenance on that price? but hauing beene trayned vp laboriouſly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a verie good ſhepheard, though he was gone from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet he could take paines and get his liuing, ſo that euerie one would be willing to haue had him; and the place where he came was much the better for him. And <hi>Iacob</hi> himſelfe<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29174:109"/> till they begin to ſet vp and inrich themſelues, by this crueltie and oppreſſion of others. Therefore eyther let it be well gotten or it will doe them no good, for it carries the curſe and plague of God, who will do more hurt then al the wealth can do good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the vſing while one hath it, vſe it well, be not a ſlaue and a drudge for his children, but let one enioy his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take his part while he liues, and reioyce in Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits with thankfulneſſe and temperateneſſe. For it is a ſoule fault that one ſhould ſay: O, I haue many children, &amp; what then? therefore, there is nothing but rauening and ſcraping: for God faith, that <hi>a good man is mercifull and lendeth,</hi> and his ſeed enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bleſſing: he is mercifull firſt to himſelfe, for mercie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at home, he will not be afraid to take a good meale, and enioy Gods benefits, becauſe of his children, but is mercifull in an honeſt cheriſhing his owne bodie, and then he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others alſo abroad, he will lend, and doe good to whom he can, and doing ſo, then his ſeed enioyeth the bleſſing, they fare the better for it.</p>
                  <p>For indeed thoſe children are alwaies beſt prouided for, whoſe parents beare this mind, that they had rather truſt God with their children, then riches with their children; and make this their hope, when wee are dead, yet God is aliue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede if God were deade or ſhould not looke to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though we were liuing, yet we might be afraid, and thinke they ſhould be vndone; but ſo long as God liueth, vſe the good meanes we can, and he will prouide for the children of his ſeruants. Therefore one ſhould neither withhold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, from any works of mercy, nor nigardly and pinchingly reſtrayne himſelfe of any neceſſarie thing, yea any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table delight for his childrens ſake.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly for diſpoſing, let this be the firſt and maine rule, that thoſe be vſed beſt, which are beſt, and thoſe haue moſt goods giuen them, that haue more grace in their hearts. So <hi>Iacob</hi> had the bleſſing, though <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt borne, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had the double portion, though he was the youngeſt but one of twelue. For grace makes the younger to be the elder, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29174:109"/> ſinne makes the elder the younger; therefore he was indeede the right heyre; for euerie one of the former ten had ſtayned themſelues with ſome ſoule and groſſe ſinne, which did put them out, and therefore they were iuſtly disinherited. So <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was not <hi>Dauids</hi> eldeſt ſonne, but hee was the ſonne of his age; yet he ſucceeded him in the kingdome, becauſe the other were proud, and vndutifull, and there was no hope that they would doe any good in Church or common weale. This muſt be the firſt then, that grace haue the firſt place; vertue muſt make the heyre. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the other alſo muſt haue their portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionablie; not one all, and all the reſt neuer a whit, as is contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practiſe, that the eldeſt muſt goe away with the whole, and the reſt haue iuſt nothing, as though he only were a lawfull child, and the reſt not legitimate; and hence growes much hurt and much heart burning, and emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren. Now God ſaith, <hi>parents muſt lay vp for their children, not for one child only.</hi> And others that if they haue no heyre male, but all daughters, the heritage muſt be put away from them and giuen to ſome other; and why ſo forſooth? becauſe of the name ſake, that the name might continue; but how know you that he ſhall continue to keepe vp your name, or how know you that he may not liue ſo, as that he ſhall be a blotte to your name and to your ſelfe, rather then a credit? why then ſhould one for a fooliſh regarde of name, breake both Gods law, and the law of nature too? For God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Numbers. 27. That if there be no ſonne the lande and heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhalbe deuided among the daughters.</hi> And thus much for the duties both of parents and children. So much for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of parents and children.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the duties of ſeruants and Maiſters. Firſt, for the duties of ſeruants. The firſt dutie is reuerence to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and that is both inward and outward. The inwarde commanded in <hi>Epheſ. b. 5. Seruants be obedient with feare and trembling. 1. Peter. 2. 18. bee ſubiect to your Maiſters with all feare. 1. Tim, 6. 1. let ſeruants count their Maiſters worthy of all honour.</hi> So that it is not enough for a ſeruant to performe all
<pb facs="tcp:29174:110"/> outward duties required at his hand, vnleſſe he begin with this firſt dutie, to haue his maſter in an high account in his heart, and to carrie a reuerend eſtimation of him in his heart; he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him worthie all honour. <hi>Paule</hi> in that place ſpeakes to chriſtian ſeruants which had vnbeleeuing and infideli Maiſters; yet he would haue them count ſuch worthy of all honour; not that their inſidelitie did deſerue to be honoured, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they carried on them the authority of God, ſtanding in Chriſts place, as his vicegerents in the familie. Becauſe of Gods ordinance thereof, and his commandement laide vpon the ſeruant he muſt reuerence his maiſter though an inſidell. So that euerie chriſtian ſeruant muſt ſet his firme concluſion with himſelfe; This is maiſter and gouernour that God hath appointed ouer me, and that ſtands in Gods roome to mee; therefore becauſe of his place, and the charge layde on me by God, I will highly and reuerently eſteeme of him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this reuerence muſt appeare in the outwarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and cariadge of the body. Elſe for one to pretende feare in the heart, and not declare it by the outward geſtures, this is not ſounde dealing, but hipocriſie and falſhood. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inward account muſt ſhew it ſelfe in the bodie, and in the actions of the bodie. As firſt, in not aunſwering againe, if they be at any time reproued, for any thing done amiſle, they muſt not haue a gainſaying proude and vndutifull ſpirit, but in all good ſpeches and ſubmiſſiue cariadge, manifeſt their inward reuerence. But contrarie to this is the vnteuerent behauiour of moſt ſeruants, eſpecially to poore men. if the maiſter be poore and meane, and of ſmall account in the world, the ſeruants take themſelues for his companions, and not as inferiours, they thinke themſelues not bounde to ſhew any dutie of ſubiection vnto him; in ſtanding bare, in bowing to him, and riſing vp be fore him; where as indeed, the poore mans ſeruant is bounde to be as dutifull to him, as if he were a Prince; for Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement reſpects not wealth, and the outward things, but only Gods ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if rich men did carrie the perſon of God vpon them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29174:110"/> and the poore the perſon of an Angell, or ſome meaner crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it were ſome thing; their commſſion hath all one ſeale, and their authoritie in both is the ſelfe ſame; and he that will ſeeme to reuerence a rich maiſter, and not a poore, is an hypocrite, and ſhewes himſelfe to be led by ſome carnall reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, not by Gods commandement. And for one to deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully with his poore maſter, that beſide the ſinne is a double iniurie, for this is to add affliction to affliction. For if he be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with contempt abroad, and be had in diſgrace of others, the ſeruant by his dutifull and reuerent dealing ſhould comfort and refreſh him, and be a meanes to mitigate his greefe; but to diſpiſe him at home, that is contemned of euerie one abroad; this is to lay a greater burden vpon him, that all readie ſinkes vnder it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if ſeruants reuerence their maiſters, they muſt not giue them frowarde ſpeaches, but euen outwardly ſhewe their inward account, and the more baſe their maiſters bee in the world, the greater reward ſhall they haue from God, and they ſhew the more truth and grace to be in their hearts. For to reuerence a rich man, that will not beare contempt, but will take him downe and cruſh him; this the verieſt hipocrite may doe, euen for his owne peace. But here is ſinceritie, here is truth of heart and vprightneſſe, if when the maſter is poore and meane and of no reckoning in the world, then the ſeruant can reckon him worthie of honour, and ſerue him with reuerence and giue him his authoritie and full allowance in all good carriage, how euer others doe debaſe and contemne him.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thing outward, wherein inferiours and ſeruants muſt ſhew their reuerence to their maſters, is in hauing a care of their name, &amp; not blazing outward their infirmities. For this is a fault of many ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that being hired to doe faithfull ſeruice, they come as ſpies into the houſe, and to ſpie out infirmities in the family, and if they can but ſpie a fault and weakeneſſe in their gouernours, then out it muſt to the diſgracing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming of the Maiſter, and to bring an euill report vpon him;
<pb facs="tcp:29174:111"/> this proues, that there is not that due account and eſtimation, for it proceeds from a diſloyall &amp; irreuerend heart, when one cares not to ſpeake ill of his gouernours. But as reuerence muſt breed a good and lowly geſture and good words to the maſter, ſo it muſt alſo bring forth good ſpeaches of the maiſter, and a concealement ſo much as may be of his wants. And hauing theſe fruites, it is proued to be true and vpright and not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and not diſſembling.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of ſeruants is to obey the Maiſter and Dame, for as they be but one fleſh, ſo make but one gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>ſeruants obey your maiſters in all thinges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to be vnderſtood, that are lawfull; for if the maſter command, to lie, or ſweare, or breake the Sabboth, that is not to be done; but in ſuch caſe it is better to obey God then man. But in all indifferent and lawfull thinges the ſeruant is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe and to obey. This obedience conſiſts both in doing things commanded cheerefully, and willingly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as alſo in ſuffering rebuke and correction, that ſhall bee laid vpon him, not only to yeeld to the commandement, but alſo to their chaſticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and as to do the worke ſet vnto them, ſo if the gouernour ſhould adminiſter correction vnto them, to indure it with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; meekenes, for the time of their ſeruice and continuance, and not to make a brawling and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>1. Peter. 2. 18. Peter</hi> commands <hi>to feare the maiſter.</hi> But what ſay you, if he be froward and churliſh, yet reuerence him ſtill; I, but hee corrects me vniuſtly; though he doe, beare it qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, ſubmit thy ſelfe, and by how much the leſſe one hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferued it, the more reward ſhal he haue from God, if with good and quiet heart he can be content to endure it, till God releaſe him of it. for if one deſeure ſharpe correction, and be content to haue it, that is no thankes to him. when the theeſe hath ſtolne and robd, and is condemned to die, then for him to be content that the rope be put about his necke, and he caſt of the ladder, that is no thankes, for he is worthy of it, and hath deſerued it, and he ſhall haue it whether he will or no, and euery man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29174:111"/> will put to his hand to helpe him to it, but if one haue done all good ſeruice with a good conſcience, and diſcharge hsi du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie faithfully, and yet not being kindly dealth with all, but for kindneſſe to receiue wrong, and for a reward ſtripes, then to ſubdue ones one pride, to tame and maiſter his fleſh and in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to recommend his cauſe to God; this is acceptable to God, this ſhewes a great meaſure of grace, and here the leſſe reward the maiſter giues, God will giue more, and Chriſt will recompence his Maiſters vnkindneſſe with kindneſſe from himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But contrarie to this, is the dealing of ſuch, that may be bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to doe manie thinges, but will doe what they liſt; and then if they be rebuked, murmur, if corrected, ſtraight ſeeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueng. This is a beaſtly and rude thinge, not to ſubmitte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Gods yoake; And thoſe parents which haue children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and heare ſuch thinges of them, let them looke to it be time, for certainely thoſe that be ſtubborne abroad, let them get a little more ſtrength and they will rebell at home; and he that will take the ſtaffe by the end, when his Maiſter or Dame come to correct him, if the parents allow this, they ſhall haue their heart full of woe and greife, if euer themſelues come to giue correction; and this is their excuſe commonly; I deſerue it not. But if narture ſhould not be giuen till moſt ſeruants confeſſe they deſerue it, it ſhould neuer be giuen; for as euery one is more damnably vilde, more curſedly wicked, and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether rooted in ſinne; ſo he is more proud and frowarde, and will leaſt yeeld himſelfe to be faultie. But deſerue it or not, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one hath deſerued more at Gods hand, by ſome other ſin, and that God ſhould ſet him in ſuch a place, and God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that we ſhould ſuffer a little for his ſake, that ſet his ſonne to ſuffer ſo much for our ſakes.</p>
                  <p>The third dutie of ſeruants, is faithfulneſſe, as is commanded <hi>Tit. 2. 10. That they ſhew all good faithfulneſſe.</hi> How is that? not pickers or ſtealers; that is not faithfulneſſe. The ſeruant then muſt be faithfull in his Maſters good, and as thriſtie and diligent in doing the workes of his maiſters familie, as if it were the
<pb facs="tcp:29174:112"/> worke of his owne owne family and for himſelfe. Let him looke that no ill gotten goods cleaue to his hands, for this is a foule treacherie, when the maiſter giues him wages, and meat and drinke and thinges due and fit, to become a theeſe and rob him; this is againſt the law of nature and of nations, to deceiue him, and bcome a ſoe to him that truſts one, and puts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in him. Therefore this ſerues to reproue ſuch as will be prig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and filching and conuerting their maſters goods to them ſelues. If either they looke for ſounde peace and comfort to their conſcience, they muſt make reſtitution of all ſuch things. This is one thing then to reſtraine one, let him remember that how much ſoeuer he ſteales: ſo much he muſt reſtore; and the fifth part thereto, or if he keepe it, he keepes Gods curſe with it, and a woe to his owne conſcience. Therefore they ſinne highly that care not what loſſe they bring to their maiſter if it be ſecret.</p>
                  <p>And alſo in an other kinde of vnfaithfulneſſe is in riotous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that can rid of no worke, but meat and drinke, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſe and drinke healths, and drinke one an other vnder the table; let them alone they be men of proofe, for ſuch matters, but if it be to doe any thing of good ſeruice to the familie, that the maſter ſhould be the better for it, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe nothing. Theſe be vnfaithfull; for an idle perſon is a companion with the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſuch be theeues, for they liue out of a calling, they obey no law, nor haue any warrant from God to vſe any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>A fourth dutie in ſeruants, is to ſerue God in their calling. For admitte one doe all the former. that he reuerence his maſter in his heart, and neuer giue him an ill word or ſhew a froward geſture, neuer diſobey him, nor be vnfaithfull nor idle, but ſo carefull, that he would not rob his maiſter of the leaſt matter in his greateſt neceſſitie: yet all this will afford no comfort, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe one haue done it for conſcience, and hath ſerued God in it. This is the mayne dutie and pillar of the reſt, that one doe it not principally becauſe his maſter commands, but becauſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29174:112"/> God commands, not becauſe his Maiſters eye is vpon him, but becauſe Gods pure eyes behold him, either to puniſh him if he doe not his dutie, or to reward him if he doe it faithfully. This is the cheeſe point at which ſeruants muſt ayme; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. <hi>Epheſ. 6. 5. In ſingleneſſe of your heart as vnto Chriſt.</hi> And there is a reaſon why one muſt cheefly ſeeke to pleaſe God and not man, for if one doe ſo, this will follow, that one ſhall not doe it in eye ſeruice, that is this, when the Maiſter lookes on to be ſo nimble and readie to doe as much as two or three; but no ſooner the Maiſters eye is turnd away, but all is giuen ouer and the time ſpent idle, and nothing is done, or if it be tis naughtily and negligently. But where this is not, that one chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects God, his obedience can neuer be conſtant, it is but by ſits and ſtarts, and hangs vpon the maſters eye; take away that and all is done. Secondly, if one ſerue not God, then he, is ſtreight diſcouraged at vnkindneſſe, heres no rewarde for ones paines, no reſpect had of ones labour; indeede if oneſerue his maſter only, he may truely ſay ſo of times, but if one ſerue God and do it in obedience to God, he cannot at anie time ſay, here is no conſideration had of ones diligence; twere impious to ſay ſo, &amp; to make God a lyar &amp; vnfaithfull. but there is ſufficient conſideration and reward if one ſerue God, for then if his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doe not recompence him, he whome he ſerueth will. As the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhewes. He ſerue a coueteous maiſter one that made no conſcience of his promiſe to a poore man, as this is alwaies the tricke of a couetous man, he cares not what promiſe he breake to a poore man. Yet <hi>Iacob</hi> made conſcience of his dutie, and endured his couetouſneſſe for twentie yeares ſpace, and ſerued him to with all his might, ſo that hee was pnicht by heat in the day, by cold in the night, and if ſleepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his eyes, and if euer any thing were ſpoild by wilde beaſts, he made it good; yet <hi>Laban</hi> all this while did nothing but ſeeke to eate him vp and to rauen all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that he could. Then God comes and tels him, that though <hi>Laban</hi> was thus churliſh yet he could haue wages enough and becauſe he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, God will pay him though man doe not, and ſo hee
<pb facs="tcp:29174:113"/> did and that throughly and fully; for by Gods owne hand and prouidence moſt of <hi>Labans</hi> beſt cattle were turned to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo he grew far more welthy, &amp; had a larger reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence then euer he looked for. So that if on ſerue two maiſters he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly haue double wages. For God will incline the heart of his maiſters to fauour him when he is faithfull, and himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will fully reward him with abundant bleſſing in his ſoule and bodie and conſcience and name and poſteritie after him. For no man euer ſerued God in a calling, but hee may as well pray for Gods bleſſing and as ſurely looke for it, be the worke neuer ſo meane and baſe, that he goes about, as the miniſter when he preacheth or prayeth or adminiſtreth the ſacrament or doth any worke of his calling.</p>
                  <p>The laſt dutie of ſeruants is to pray for their gouernours, and for good ſucceſſe vpon their labours in their gouernours buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This is commanded. <hi>1. Tim. 2.</hi> Where it is commanded that not euery place of authoritie one is in, the inferiour ſhould pray to God for him, if he be bad to conuert him, &amp; be mercifull to him, if good, to ſtrengthen him, and giue him continuance and increaſe of theſe graces. Likewiſe, when ſeruants goe about matters of weight concerning their maiſter, they muſt pray to God for direction and ſucceſſe; as when <hi>Abraham</hi> truſted his ſeruant with a great matter, namely to fetch a wife for his ſonne: he goes about with prayer to God to direct him; and giue him a good proceeding and euent; and where God had bleſſed him; he giues thankes to God and prayſeth him. as hee would not truſt his own ſtrength but cals to God for aſſiſtance, ſo hauing obtained aſſiſtance he lets God haue the praiſe, and then when he was intreated to ſtay ten daies and might haue had all courteous and liberall intertainment, yet he would not, but tels them that ſeeth God had bleſſed him, and his maiſter expected his comming, they ſhould not nowe hinder him, and nothing could containe him from his Maiſter that looked for him.</p>
                  <p>This confutes thoſe that neuer pray God to giue a bleſſing to their gouernours, and to beſtow grace vpon their maſters,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29174:113"/> and hence it iuſtly comes to paſſe, that they want many good things from their maſters which they ſhoud haue, becauſe they performe not all the duties of a good ſeruant, in that they call not vpon God for their maſter. And thoſe are alſo repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that will be deſirous to be employed in their maſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and to haue dealing in buſineſſes committed to them, but they are ſo preſumptuous in a carnall confidence of their owne abilitie, that they runne boy ſtrouſly and rudely vpon matters, not entreating the helpe of the great God in things of great moment, and then it is iuſt that God ſhould croſſe them, becauſe they take away that he neuer ſanctified, and if they will not aske a bleſſing, is not it righteous that he ſhould turne their wit into folly, and though they goe about it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, croſſe and ouerturne all their policy, becauſe they truſt more in policie then in his bleſſing? The ſeruant therfore muſt craue Gods aſſiſtance, that he may vſe good meanes, after a good manner, and with good ſucceſſe. And an other vſe heere is to be made of thoſe which haue beene ſeruants, but now are not; this is their dutie, euen to goe backe and ſee, wherein they haue fayled in any of theſe things, and for that aske mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie at Gods hand and craue pardon, elſe they ſhall be lyable to theſe two euils.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; that God may iuſtly plague them now for their former ſinnes, and ſecondly, that as they failed in their dutie to their maſters, ſo their ſeruants ſhall faile in dutie to them, whereas if one haue repented, he may looke and haue ſome hope that God in mercy will ſo order his ſeruants hearts, as that they ſhal not recompence his owne euill vnto him, becauſe the blood of Chriſt hath waſhed it away. But ſuch as will pilfer &amp; deale wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly with their maſters, &amp; not repent for it, and make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it is moſt iuſt from God, that they themſelues ſhould be ſpoyld and robd without any amends.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the duties of ſeruants; the duties of the maſter follow. For as God binds the inferiour to his duty, ſo he requires that the ſuperiour be carefull in his place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling too. Now the maſters duties conſiſt in two maine points.
<pb facs="tcp:29174:114"/> Namely, in choſing them with wiſedome and diſcretion, and in vſing them with a good conſcience, a good wiſe choice and a chriſtian and honeſt vſe. Now for chooſing the maine dutie and the chiefe thing to be regarded is, that they get ſuch vnder their roofe as be the ſeruants of God, ſuch as haue grace and vertue in their harts, &amp; cary a good conſcience with them. This duty is confirmed by the example of <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 101.</hi> where his example ſets down a rule how euery one ſhould order his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſhewes that for wicked perſons, teltales, proud perſons, ſwaggerers, ſuch as haue great looks &amp; no grace, he would haue none of them for his ſeruants, but thoſe that were religious vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſuch ſhould be his ſcruants. And there is good reaſon why one ſhould be carefull to take none into his familie but Chriſtias, for if they be not faithfull to God, as ſure as God liues they will neuer be faithfull to their maſter. For all obedience and faithfulneſſe flowes from the firſt table, &amp; begins there, but if a man neglect his dutie where he hath more hands to tie him to it, he will be much more ſlacke where he hath fewer bands. Secondly, a wicked perſon is verie contagious, and will infect the children with his lawdneſſe and euill behauiour; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many can tell by experience, that the ill example, and the vilde perſwaſions of one vngodly, will doe more harme to the children, then all that many good ſeruants can do, will do them good. So that this is euen to bring a leprous perſon among the whole, and a contagious man among the ſound. Thirdly, a wicked perſon doth bring Gods curſe vpon the family, euen as a good ſeruant hath Gods bleſſing going with him as we ſee in <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> So when an vngodly ſinfull fellow hath the fingring and and dealing in a matter, the curſe of God purſues and followes him, for ſo it is ſaid: <hi>The curſe of God is vpon the houſe of the ſwearer, and vpon the houſe of the theeſe, not onely vpon his owne heart, but euen vpon the houſe and habitation, where ſuch an one is kept and maintained and countenanced.</hi> But ſhall I be plagued and puniſhed for my ſeruants ſinnes? yes and iuſtly too; for he that will relieue and retaine ſuch an one, that he knowes is an enemie to God, muſt needs open his doores to the curſe of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29174:114"/> God. So that if one would not haue the curſe of God to reſt vpon his houſe, nor vnfaithfulnes in his ſeruants, nor his houſe poyſoned with that leproſie, which, onely the blood of Chriſt can heale, let him take good aduice in choſing his ſeruants, and in planting his family.</p>
                  <p>And thus wiſely men can deale for other matters, for he that purpoſeth to plant him a good orchard, will not runne to euerie hedge and euerie groue, and all the bramble buſhes he can ſee, and thence take him plants for his orchard; but if he hope for any benefit by his orchard, he will make prouſion for the beſt graffes and ſciences he can get, and thoſe will he ſet in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and ſo he hopes it may hereafter turne him to good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. But if one would ſay, why I hope, and I looke to haue as fruitfull and commodious an orchard as any man in the pariſh; but what doth he in the meane while, what courſe takes he in planting it, why heeres a bryer &amp; there is a crabtree, and there a thorne; theſe be all the plants he lookes for, and hence he cuts all his ſciences; why then it is plaine he doth but diſſemble, he is not in good earneſt. So for thoſe that be ſheepemaſters and hope for commoditie that way, they will enquire and marke out of what ground, the ſheepe they purpoſe to buy come, where they were bred, &amp; if they were bred in a rotten ground, eſpecially if they haue a rotten bleake too, he will not put them in his fold, nor let them come among the reſt, leaſt they ſhould be all infected. Will one deale thus for his orchard, and for his ſheepe, and ſhould he not conſider likewiſe in planting his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? When he takes a ſeruant into his fold, out of what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture comes he? hath he beene brought vp in a rotten ground? In a place of diſorder of riot, of ſwearing of breaking the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and ſuch like? and hath he a rotten bleake? will ſweare, will he lye, wil he ſpeak filthily, doth he looke like a ſwaggerer, and like a ruffian? and will you venture on yet? then you are a fooliſh maſter, and loue neyther your ſelfe, nor your houſe, nor children, if you take ſuch vnto them, that will eyther infect them if they be not verie good, or if they be, will vexe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:115"/>
                  <p>Therefore here many maſters are to be reproued; that ſcorne to be admoniſhed of the miniſter, but God will find them out, that vſe more care by farre in planting their orchards, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſheepe to breed, then they doe in planting their family and choſing out ſeruants. Such as may bring glorie to God, and profit to the Church, and be for their owne commoditie alſo. And yet this folly raignes in them too, that of all men they are the moſt readie, to complaine of ill ſeruants, and how neuer any was ſo troubled as they, with vntruſtie ſeruants, that they muſt ſtill be chaunging. As if one ſhould ſay, neuer any man had ſo bad an orchard, why? what is the matter? you ſee others haue peares, and apples, and plums, and good fruit; and I come to mine, and find nothing but hips and hawes, and ſloes. I pray you what did you plant there then? did not you ſet thornes and brambles? and can you looke for better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of ſuch wares? Therefore euen thanke your ſelfe, and your owne folly, that could make no better a choice at the firſt; ſo for theſe maſters; will they take ſeruants at all aduentures, and then crie out, they be not faithfull? let them blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues then, that would not at the firſt ſee they were religious, afore they intertained them.</p>
                  <p>It is then a great and common fault amongſt moſt maſters, that haue no regard of grace and religion; but if he be ſuch an one as will take a little wages, and pleaſe him in euerie thing, and ſerue his luſt; take him, what euer he be, papiſt, atheiſt, ſwaggerer, theeſe, drunkard, or anything, care not. That is the leaſt part of their thought. But no man ſhall haue Gods bleſſing in his ſeruice, vnleſſe he will chuſe ſuch as will ſerue God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond point of the maſters du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in vſing, and that when they dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in part. direction in recompence. matters of religion. matters of calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:29174:115"/>
                  <p>For direction in matters of religion and Gods ſeruice, the maſter muſt looke that they come to the publike aſſemblies in due time, and that they tarrie it out, and ſit in a conuenient place where they may heare &amp; learne, and not in ſuch by-corners and obſcure odde places, where they ſpend their time in prating or ſcoffing or ſleeping or ſuch like. This is no good direction in the maſter, when he lets his ſeruants come into the Church to proclaime their owne ſhame and his diſgrace. Therefore firſt he muſt deale with them plainly; you muſt ſerue God, if yee ſerue me, and be religious in Gods houſe if ye will haue any countenance in my houſe. Secondly, for the works and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of their calling, the maſters direction is neceſſarie, and he muſt appoint the worke, and ſet euerie one his place and dutie which he muſt doe, elſe the houſe may be full of ſeruants, and full of confuſion, and nothing be well done or in any good order. And this is commended in the vertuous woman, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs. 31.</hi> that ſhe giues her ſeruants their portion of meat and of worke; the maſter therefore that the houſe may be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, muſt let euerie one know his place and calling, and his taske, that the weaker may haue the weaker worke, and the ſtronger the ſtronger. For the maſter muſt conſider his worke and buſineſſe that is to be done, and what his ſeruants can do, ſo that none of them may be oppreſſed, nor any be idle; for if eyther of theſe things come to paſſe, that his ſeruants be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouerburthened or elſe may loyter, it is for want of good direction in the gouernour, the houſe might be inriched, euerie thing might be done in good order, and would fall out in their iuſt and due compaſſe, when euerie one were diligent in his place, and ſet to doe that thing to which he was moſt ſit.</p>
                  <p>For want of this it comes to paſſe, that many fooliſh maſters when they ſee things fall out amiſſe, and there is not that good order that ſhould be, are readie to chafe and fret, and then they crie out, what diſorder? And ſo they may wel enough indeed; for there is diſorder and confuſion, but where begins it? Is it not from the diſordered gouernment and gouernour? becauſe he performes not his dutie well, the others can doe no
<pb facs="tcp:29174:116"/> good. Like as if a fooliſh pilot at the ſterne, ſhould neuer giue anie direction to thoſe in other offices about the ſhip, when, and what they ſhould doe, he might ſweat and toyle himſelfe, but the ſhip might be daſht againſt euerie rocke, and ſinke well enough, and all through his folly in want of good guiding. But if the maſter be diligent in his place to direct his ſeruants, and to appoint them what is to be done, then if he ſee any fault and negligence, he may and muſt let them heare of it. And if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition will not doe, nor a rebuke ſerue the turne, then chaſticement and correction muſt follow, for the rod is for the fooles backe. But alwaies in correction, theſe rules muſt be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it be not in paſſion to eaſe ones ſelfe by the ſeruants paine, but with compaſſion to helpe him out of his ſinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it be ioyned with prayer, or elſe it is not inſtruction but reuenge. Thirdly, that for ordinarie, and leſſer one take not notice of them, but let them ſlip: as in <hi>Eccleſiaſt. 7. 23.</hi> he ſaith: <hi>Giue not thine heart to all the words that men ſpeake, leaſt thou heare thy ſeruant curſing thee, for oftentimes thine heart knoweth that thou alſo haſt curſed others. Salomon</hi> would not haue one haue too quicke an eare to marke and take notice of the ill ſpeeches of his ſeruants, and he adds a good reaſon; be cauſe no man is ſo good, but his heart can tell him that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſpoken as bad words againſt his gouernours and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo that ſith he himſelfe hath beene iniurious to his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, it ſhould make him ſomething to paſſe by the iniurie of his inferiours. Thus much for direction.</p>
                  <p>The next part of the maſters dutie to the ſeruant that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with him, is in recompence, as he muſt be diligent in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to worke; and looke that he diſcharge the taske laid vpon him according to his ſtrength; ſo there muſt be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence made firſt in wages, and that proportionable to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their worke which they doe, and paid alſo in the time, appointed. The maſter muſt not put of his ſeruant from day to day, to make him groane and ſigh to God, or elſe for need to theeue and ſteale from him. It is a verie diſhoneſt thing in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29174:116"/> maſter not to pay his ſeruants due wages, and that in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, keeping day and in good tearmes, and willingly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. It is a moſt indigne and baſe thing, that the ſeruant ſhould ſee ſuch a greedie couetouſneſſe in him, as that he payes him with grudging, and ſo vnwillingly, that he muſt be conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to beg for it, as if it were an almes. And thus he diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his authoritie, and leſſons his reuerence exceedingly, when they can perceiue that he doth wholy ſerue himſelfe, and is willing enough to haue as much worke done as may be, but is verie loth to part with any wages.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond matter of recompence is in the diet, and food of his ſeruants. While they be well and in good health, he muſt ſee that they haue wholſome &amp; ſufficient food, and that in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conuenient time. For it is more then barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie for one to ride his horſe hard all day, and at night rayne him vp without meat, to repayre and ſuſtaine his ſtrength; and he were worſe then a beaſt that would deale ſo with a beaſt, but much more to deale thus with a man that beares the image of God, and is redeemed with the blood of Chriſt Ieſus as well as the maſter, to weare him out, and ſpend his bodie, and not allow him that nouriſhment, that may keepe his ſtrength in repayre, is more then barbarous and ſauge crueltie. Therfore while the ſeruant is in health, the maſter muſt ſee that he haue all things neceſſarie for health and ſuſtenance, ſuch for qualitie as it be wholſome, &amp; ſo much for quantity as it be ſuſſicie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he be no way pinched or weakned. Then if the ſeruant be ſicke, he muſt prouide to his power all good meanes for his health and recouerie, and for the good looking to hime in time of his weakenes. And this is noted as a matter of commendation in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> that when his ſeruant was ſick, he went to Chriſt and tooke the beſt way he could deuice for his helpe and eaſe. For the maſter in the ſickneſſe of his ſeruant is to looke to the hand of God that ſmiteth him, and therby to be humbled; for it is a chaſticement laid vpon him that God by his owne hand immediately ſhould turne thoſe into a burthen and trouble to him, that he did hire for helpes and for his profit, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb facs="tcp:29174:117"/> they ſhould haue. Therefore he muſt ſubmit himſelfe to God, and as well in obedience to God, as in a pitifull hart to his diſtreſſed, be diligent both to pray to God for him, and to vſe all lawfull and good meanes for his eaſe and ſuccour. Thus men will deale with verie beaſts; If it be an horſe or oxe, that when he was well, was verie ſeruiceable, and by it painefull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell brought in much profit vnto the maſter, if he be diſeaſed by ſome ſore or ſickneſſe, he will let him haue reſt and looke carefully to him, that he want nothing, and take the counſell of ſome one that is skilfull in ſuch matters, for ſome drench or medecine that may helpe his horſe or oxe, &amp; reſtore his health. Thus men will deale with a beaſt, but what maſter almoſt can be found, that doth not plainely proue, that he loues a beaſt more for his commoditie ſake, then he doth a man for Gods ſake? for he that will be content to be at coſt and charges, and ſome trouble alſo with his diſeaſed and ſicke horſe, his ſicke ſeruant may lie and die, and he will neuer come at him, nor ſeeke any remedie for him, but rather encreaſe his paines by murmuring and grudging, that he eates, and he drinkes and doth nothing but ſpend, and burthen the familie. And when Gods hand hath reſtrained him from working, and not his owne negligence, and ofttimes when he gets his weakeneſſe by faithfull and painefull ſeruice done to him, then ſome are ſo cruelly and miſerably coueteous, as that they will abate ſo much of their wages, as the time of their ſickneſſe comes to. And when he ſuffers paine and griefe enough by his ſicknes, then he that ſhould looke to healing of him, doth not onely neglect that, but alſo, gleanes from him, and robs him of his wages, which is a double ſinne and iniurie. So much for the duetie of maſters to their ſeruants that dwell with them.</p>
                  <p>Now when they part, the maſters duty is to looke that he ſend not his ſeruant away emptie, but doe ſomething for him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bleſſing of God vpon him by his ſeruants labour, &amp; according to his owne abilitie; and looke how much longer time the ſeruant hath beene with him, and howe much more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29174:117"/> faithfull ſeruice he hath done to him, by ſo much more muſt he be franke and bountifull in reſpecting and beleeuing him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this is the dealing of thoſe ſhiſters, that muſt haue new ſeruants euerie yeare, for that either they be ſo bad themſelues as none will ſtay with them longer then needes they muſt, or els they intertaine ſuch vngodly perſons into there familie, as it is not ſit that they ſhould tarrie long in any place. And thoſe that take in ſuch manner ſeruants as deſerue noe recompence, becauſe they imploy their labour about ſuch things, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie hath no benefit by them, but are fit only to ſerue their Maiſters luſt, in vanitie and fooliſhneſſe: for ſuch it is iuſt that though they dwell manie yeares in a place they ſhould haue no reward giuen them, becauſe their labour hath brought no good to the familie, no bodie hath beene a gayner or bettered by it. but here was a great fault on both parts; for both the Maſter was a foole to giue harbour to ſuch vnprofitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and the ſeruant was a foole, to ſpende his time and paines about ſuch baſe ſeruice as could be benefit to no bodie; and here it is iuſt that both ſhould be looſers. But when one hath had a ſeruant that hath beene with him a longe time and done him faithfull ſeruice, ſo imploying his labour and ſpending both his daies and ſtrength as that ſome profitte and commoditie redownds to the familie; And the maiſters eſtate hath beene better by his carefull diligence; now by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time and by this profitable ſocietie they had, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſhould grow to be vnto him as a child, and he if he will ſeeme to be one of a good nature vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long experience of his faithfull and louing cariage, ſhould put on the affection of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him. For indeede nature ſhewes that it is a ſhame for one to put away his old ſeruant, that hath worne out his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in his ſeruice, without beſtowing his liberalitie vpon him in ſome meaſure, according to his owne abilitie and his ſeruants labours. But it is the cuſtome of moſt men now a dayes (ſo wretchedly couetous are they growne,) that they deale with their ſeruants as one would deale with an horſe when he grows old and can doe nothing any longer, that may bring profit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:29174:118"/> pull his skinne ouer his eares and caſt his bodie to the dogs; and thus brutiſh are vnnaturall men to their ſeruants ofttimes, toyle them while they can labour, conſume their ſtrength and ſpend them out, then age will come and the bones will growe weake, and the bodie waxe feeble and faint; one cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies young and ſtrong, and what then? Then turne them out of dores poore and helpeleſſe into the wide world, to ſhift for themſelues as they can; and they muſt either beg, or ſteale, or ſterue, and thus it comes to paſſe that manie become theeues and vagrant beggers, through the maſters baſe niggardlineſſe, that would not doe his dutie in beſtowing ſome proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and competent releefe vpon them.</p>
                  <p>So much for their duties that bee further of from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie in the familie, as parents and childe, Maſters and ſeruants.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe that are more equall are the husband and wife, whoſe duties are either common to both or more particuler to either of them. The common duties are theſe. Firſt, they muſt loue one an other with a pure heart feruently. This dutie both husband and wife muſt performe naturally one to an other. Which that they may the better ſtriue for, let vs conſider of ſome excellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, that will proceede from this loue and wich indeede will ſhew in their practiſe whether their bee this loue or not. Firſt, this benefit will certainly enſue, where there is loue betweene man and wife, they will be chaſt and true hearted, ſo farre as they loue one the other truely, they are garded from all ſtrange luſts euen in heart, that they will not allowe any vnchaſt deſire, much leſſe any vnchaſt looke or action. For ſo in <hi>Prouerbs. 5. 19. 20. Delight in thy wife and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in her loue, for why ſhouldeſt thou goe after ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſure enough if thou doe not loue thy wife, thou wilt follow a whoare, or at the leaſt art in daunger to doe it; but if thou loue thy wife, truely thou art ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt a ſtranger. And ſo may it be ſaide of the woman concerning her husband. For it is not the hauing of a wife that makes a man chaſt, and keepes him from filthineſſe, but the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29174:118"/> of his wife that will keepe him; and ſo it is not the hauing of an husband, that makes a woman honeſt, and preſerues her from adulterers, but it is the louing of her husband which will doe it. For many married men and women, liue filthilie and impurely; but if they did loue one an other they were ſafe from that fault. This then is one benefit, it is a moſt ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ones chaſtitie to loue each other.</p>
                  <p>An other benefit that conſtant loue will bring is, that they ſhall be verie patient; abundance of loue breeds aboundance of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for loue hopes all thinges and ſuffer all thinges. And loue is not prouoked, but where there is little loue, their is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bearing and little hoping, and there they be quickly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; vpon euerie light and ſmall defect or fault, they grow to chaſing and brawles, and then who euer was troubled with ſuch a husband or ſuch a wife? Nay they might rather ſay who euer had ſuch an vnloving and vnkind heart as I? for if there were that loue that ſhould be, and in that meaſure that there is that loue, they would beare with patience and meake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſuch infirmities, and would not be ſo quickely prouoked nay not by greater matters. As the mother that in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and without diſſembling loues her little childe though it crie all night and be vnquiet and breake her ſleepe and diſquiet her verie much; yet ſhee will not fling it out of doores, nor lay it at further end of the houſe, furtheſt from her, but ſhee vſeth it kindly and will doe what ſhee can to ſtill it, and when it cries ſhee will ſing, and in the morning they be as good friends as euer before, and ſhee feeds it, and tends it neuer a whit the leſſe for all the nights trouble. One that were not acquainted, and knew not the loue of the mother would wonder; why? did it not diſquiet your reſt all night, and can you be ſo merrie with it now? Yes ſhee can, for ſhee loued it, and ſhee hath forgotten all that in the morning. And ſo indeed, could the husband and wife loue one an other with ſuch a pure and chriſtian loue, they would beare much, and endure much, and yet loue neuer a whit the leſſe. For loue is all waies a breſtplate againſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:119"/>
                  <p>A third profit that ſpringes from loue is, that loue edifies; and loue ſeekes not it owne thinges; therefore if they loue one an other, they will in all thinges ſeeke the good one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then if he ſee a fault in his wife he will tell her of it meekly and gently, and labour to bring her to amendment; &amp; then if he ſee any fault of his part, ſhee will with all reuerence and humilitie admoniſh him of it. But on the contrarie, where there is not loue, they will regard their owne eaſe more then the ſaluation one of an other.</p>
                  <p>Then if the husband ſee his wife in any fault, he thinkes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it is a ſinne, but if I come to tell her of it, ſhe will ſtreight be in a paſſion and chafe, and ſo the wife; I confeſſe this ſinne is dangerous to my husbands ſoule, but if I ſhould goe about to admoniſh him, he is ſo hiddie, that he would be bitter &amp; furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt me preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. But now here is a great want of loue in eyther partie. For what though your wife will be in a paſſion? he that loues his wife, would rather ſhee ſhould be in paſſion againſt him for a litle time, then God with her for euer. And the wife that loues her husband would more willingly ſuffer her husbands anger and futie for a while for well doing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould ſuffer Gods wrath eternally for ill doing. Whereas they not louing one an other, put it of with ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; dare not ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>A fourth fruit of loue is, that it armes one againſt iealouſie, the poyſon of all dutie; for loue will neither bee ſuſpicious in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of goods, nor iealous in matters of the bodie. For all iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpicion (I ſpeake of euill iealouſie and ſuſpicion for if their be euident and apparant cauſes and reaſons, then it is iuſt and no fault) but all ill iealouſie &amp; cauſleſſe ſuſpicion ariſeth of one of theſe two points. Firſt, either that one is or hath beene wicked himſelfe, and hauing beene faultie and naught him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he is readie to iudge others by himſelfe, and to meaſure all with his owne meaſure, or elſe from a doting affection, that one makes a God of this or that thing, &amp; this is not true loue. So when the wife doats fooliſhly vpon her husband, and makes an idoll of him; then is ſhee quickely readie to be iealous, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a true and ſound loue would worke the contrarie effect in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29174:119"/> her. So for matters of goods, he that truſts in them will truſt no bodie with them, but is alwaies ſuſpitious and miſdemeaning, and will neither truſt wife, nor ſeruants, nor children nor any, not becauſe they would not deale faithfully enough, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes that his God. And therefore is immoderatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to looſe it; but where there is a pure and ſeruent loue, that will cut of all needleſſe and miſdeemings both in goods and bodie. This is the firſt dutie that is common both to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande and wife.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond followes, and that is faithfulneſſe. That both bende their wits and all their endeuours, to the helpe each of other and to the common good of the familie. The husband muſt not follow his priuate pleaſure and delight, nor the wife her owne eaſe &amp; pride, but though by nature they could both be content to ſeeke themſelues; Yet they muſt ſtriue both to build vp the houſe, and to doe good one to an other and not hurt. Becauſe they ſtand in the place of Chriſt to thoſe that are committed vnto them both for their ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the husband and wife muſt be faithfull in their bodies one to an other, elſe, they breake the couenant of God. For mariage is not a couenant of man, but a couenant of God; where in the parties binde themſelues to God and they be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance in heauen, to keepe themſelues pure and chaſt one to an other. Then for other matters, there muſt be one purſe and one heart, and hand for the good of the familie, and each of other. But now if the wife be waſtfull and idle, then ſhe like a fooliſh woman puls downe her houſe; And if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be an vnthrift, and conſume and ſpende that idly and vainely to ſerue his luſt, or pride or anie ſinne, that might helpe his wife and children, and be a meanes to make them liue plentifully and cheerefully, whereas now they are pinched with want and neceſſitie; this lauiſhing is a great vnfaithfulneſſe, and comes accompanied with manie inconueniences. So much for the generall duties belonging both to husbande and wife. The particular follow. And firſt, the wife muſt feare her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb facs="tcp:29174:120"/> as is commanded in <hi>Epheſ. 5. 33. Let the wife ſee that ſhee feare her husband.</hi> and <hi>1. Peter. 3. 2.</hi> The Apoſtle requires a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with feare. So that if euer the wife will be comfortable and profitable to the husband and doe anie good in the family, ſhee muſt haue a care of her heart, and looke that ſhee carrie an inwarde feare to her husbande; for the husband is the wiues head euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church, and euen as the Church muſt feare Chriſt Ieſus, ſo muſt the women alſo feare their husbands; And this inward feare muſt be ſhewed by an outward meekeneſſe &amp; lowlineſſe in the ſpeaches and cariadge to the husband. As in the place aboue named out of <hi>Peter</hi> he ſaith they muſt be attired <hi>with a meeke and quiet ſpirit;</hi> ſhee muſt not be paſſionate and frowarde to him either to anie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie in his ſight, but ſhould haue ſuch a regard of his preſence, as that ſhould gouerne her tongue and countenance, ſo that it may not be offenſiue or troubleſome to him. And for her ſpeeche, neither when they be kind and louing together muſt ſhee growe into groſſe tearmes, nor if any Iarte or offence come, ruſh into tart and ſowre words, to eaſe her ſelfe vpon her husband whome ſhee ſhould feare. Thus muſt ſhee imitate <hi>Sarah</hi> and good women as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, and in ſo doing ſhee ſhall proue her ſelfe a daughter of <hi>Sarah</hi> a true chriſtian. but contrarily if ſhe behaue her ſelfe rudely and vnmannerly in her husbands ſight to greiue him and offend him, ſhee fails in the firſt and maine dutie of a good wife, and ſo far ſhall ſurely come ſhort of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of the wife is conſtant obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. Now in what, and after what manner this obedience muſt be performed, the holy ghoſt doth declare. for in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall there is no woman allmoſt ſo rude, but ſhe will yeeld that ſhee muſt obey her husband; but in particular thinges there growes the queſtion and in the manner of it there is the failing. Therefore the Apoſtle hath to put all out of doubt ſet downe both the matter and maner. <hi>Epheſ. 5. 24. As the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, ſo let the wife be to the husband in all thinges.</hi> For the thinges in which ſhe muſt obey he ſayes, in all things,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29174:120"/> meaning in all lawfull thinges. for the comandement of the husband is as it were the ſtampe of God ſet vpon the thinge commanded, and if ſhee rebell againſt his commandement she rebels againſt God; the wife then muſt perſwade her ſelfe that her husbands charge is Gods charg, and when he ſpeakes God ſpeakes, and therefore ſhe muſt reſolue to obey him in all things. Then for the manner he ſaith as the Church obeyes Chriſt. Now we know that the Church obeyes Chriſt willingly &amp; cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a free heart, and though the thinges which Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it be often times verie contrarie to nature, and no whitte at all delightfull to the fleſh, yet the true Church will more ſet by the commandement of Chriſt then her owne pleaſure, and haue a greater regard to pleaſe him then to ſerue the deſires of the fleſh. Therefore the wife muſt obey her husbande in all thinges cheerefully and willingly without gaineſaying. Theſe be the duties of a worthy woman, of a daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> and a chriſtian wife. Which ſo farre as ſhee is carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, ſo far as ſhee may looke that her husband ſhould doe the dutie of a good husband vnto her, or if hee doe not, yet God will rewarde her liberally. For ſuch a woman is much ſet by of God, and that not with an idle affection that no bodie can ſee, but with ſuch a working loue as ſhall ſhew it ſelfe by good effect outwardly in plentiful bleſſings on her ſoule and bodie, if ſhee can frame for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſake to God, to yeelde a willing and free obedience to her huſband in all lawfull things &amp; that with a meeke &amp; lowly cariage of her ſelfe proceeding from an holy feare and reuerence of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods ſteade.</p>
                  <p>Now follow the ſpeciall duties of an husband, for hee hath not all theſe priuiledges for nothing, and thoſe conſiſt in two maine points.</p>

                  <p>Firſt for cohabitation. The firſt dutie of the husband is to dwell with his wife, that ſeeth there is a neere and deare ſocietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and of all the neareſt; for ſhe is to him as the Church vnto Chriſt, fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone; therefore he muſt be willing to haue his aboad to walke with her, and talke with her and let her haue all comfortable familiaritie with him: that ſhee may ſee, he delighteth in her companie and may well know, that of all others ſhee is his moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come companion. And ſo in the law it was commanded that the firſt yeare anie one was married, he might dwell at home &amp; reioyce with his wife for that whole yeare, what euer affaires of the common wealth or iarres were abroade, yet he was by Gods lawes freed, ſo that neither King nor captaine might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſeruice from home, but he muſt dwell with his wife that ſhee might haue experience of his loue, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by him, that by long continuance and ſocietie, their hearts might be ſo neerely glewed as nothing might rend them a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This confutes thoſe fooliſh men indeede not worthie to carrie the names of husbands, that can take more delight in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie fooliſh riotous and vnthriftie companie, &amp; haue more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in any fooliſh vaine and lewd exerciſes, then in the ſociety of the louing and kind wife; that are neuer ſo merrie as when the wife is abſent, and neuer dumpiſh and churliſh but with her. So if that it may well be ſeene, that her company is a burden and her preſence a clogge vnto them, ſuch as dwell with hawkes and hownds and drunkards and gamſters not with their wiues. Theſe ſhall carrie the brande and name of fooles ſo long as they haue no more care to preuent ſo much ill, and doe ſo much good as if they had any godly wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e or loue to their wiues they might. For what doe they but flying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger &amp; lay their wiues naked to <hi>Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation? yea &amp; giue iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think that they loue the not. ô but we muſt haue our delights &amp; follow our ſports: &amp; pray you why? might not the wif ſay, I muſt haue my delight too &amp; haue part of recre ation as well as parte of the trouble is mine, yet this would not be counted a good excuſe for a woman to be ranging abroade,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29174:121"/> but they looke that ſhe ſhould accept their company and be willing to be with them, and why ſhould not they then be as willing to dwell with them according to Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? So that the husband muſt dwell with his wife, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer depart from her but vpon a lawfull and good calling: and then alſo ſo, as ſhe may perceiue, he doth rend himſelf in twain, and carries but a part of himſelfe, but ſtill leaues his heart at home with his wife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hee muſt dwell with her as a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and edifie her both by a good example, and alſo by good inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>For his example, firſt, he muſt carie himſelfe ſo wiſely, and ſo holily, as that he may ſee in him a patterne &amp; image of grace and wiſedome, he muſt be a glaſſe vnto her by looking into which, ſhe may learne to attire her ſelfe in all holy wiſedome. Therefore he muſt neither be froward, teſtie, or lumpiſh, for then he ſhall be hated, nor light, vaine, and fooliſh, for then he ſhall be diſpiſed. He muſt not be baſe, miſing, and nigardly, for then his baſe heart will breed a baſe eſtimation of him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt he be prodigall, lauiſh and vnthrifty, for then he ſhall ſo pinch himſelfe with want and neceſſitie, as that he ſhall not be able to relieue and refreſh his family, and then he depriues himſelfe of his reuerence. For want of this wiſe and holy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage it comes to paſſe, that many can ſpeake much of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a woman, and make large diſcourſes of the impotencie of that ſexe, when indeed it is long of themſelues, as if the head ſhould lead the bodie among bryars and thornes, and daſh it againſt euerie wall, and then complayne, what? was euer head ioyned to ſuch a body, ſee how it ſmarts, &amp; akes, and takes on. So many fooliſh men whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould frame themſelues ſo, as to draw their wiues to godlineſſe and reuerence by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they by rude and abſurd behauiour draw themſelues into contempt, and put vndutifulnes vpon their wiues as it were perforce, and then are readie to complaine and exclayme of them, when they ſhould rather crie out of their owne folly.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:122"/>
                  <p>Next the husband muſt edifie his wife by inſtruction, for ſo, <hi>1. Cor. 14. 35.</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If women will learne they muſt aske their husbands at home.</hi> The husband then muſt be ſo well furniſhed with ſound knowledge, as that he muſt be able to teach his wife, and ſow the ſeed of Gods word in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And one ſpeciall and chiefe part of wiſedome in the husband, by which he muſt learne to frame his inſtruction, is to obſerue thoſe good things which he ſeeth in his wife, and to cheriſh them; for nothing is more forcible to encourage a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in any good thing, then that ſhe perceiueth that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doth worke and approue thoſe good things which are in her, as well as the faults to reproue them; and for want of this encouragement that men are continually chiding, and neuer goe about to nouriſh any good thing, it fals out that many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which by good vſage might be brought to goodnes, grow too diſtemperate in rage and paſſion. And as he muſt labour to encreaſe the good things that are in her, ſo alſo he muſt ſeeke to amend and cure thoſe things that are faultie, wherein ſhe doth amiſſe, &amp; for ordinarie infirmities he muſt paſſe by them; onely pray to God for her. But if it be a thing that needeth phiſicke, and muſt haue a medicine; a wiſe gouernour, will choſe his fitteſt time, and conſider the nature and diſpoſition of a wife; that if ſhe be of a gentle ſpirit, he may vſe gentle meanes which will then doe moſt good, but if ſhe be of a more hard nature, rougher meanes muſt be vſed, and ſhe muſt be dealt withall after a more round manner, but alwaies proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it neuer be done in paſſion and before others, but with a quiet and mercifull heart, that ſhe may ſee that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her ſaluation and not diſgrace; not to eaſe himſelfe vpon her, but to conuert her ſoule. But if the husband be violent in company to reproue, of badde he ſhall make her worſe, and more alienate her from him, becauſe ſhe ſeeth, that ſhe hath a foole that is not a ſauiour, but a deſtroyer. And for want of this diligent care in choſing time and place, and obſeruing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the partie, it comes to paſſe that rebukes which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are good, and ought to be performed, do more hurt then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29174:122"/> good, becauſe he obſerues not where he doth it, but reproues her before company, to which he ſhould not diſcloſe his and her ſhame. And then alſo moſt vnſeaſonably and vntimely, for when ſhe is out of temper, and paſſion hath alreadie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her, then he fals to adminiſter his phiſicke as it were vpon a full ſtomacke. Whereas he ſhould patiently wait for a fit time, and not be ſo fooliſh as when ſhe is gone, and anger hath ouerrulde her, then to looke that ſhe ſhould vpon a words war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning returne and come againe into her right minde, &amp; vpon the ſudden reforme all that is amiſſe, for this is not wiſedome but teſtimonie of his folly, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any true loue or diſcretion. But what? ſhall one let his wife go away ſo, &amp; take her courſe? No, but he muſt at that inſtant ſpeake to God for her, when ſhe is not fit to be ſpoken to. And afer when the coaſt is cleare, &amp; all is quiet, then with a louing heart &amp; good countenance, &amp; yet with plaine and euident proofes and reproofes out of Gods word, he muſt ſhew her fault, that godly ſorrow may bring her to repentance and amendment. And by theſe meanes he may gouerne well.</p>
                  <p>An other dutie of the husband is, in giuing her all honour and due beneuolence, which ſtands in two things. Firſt, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and allowing her all maintenance &amp; needfull helpes both for neceſſitie, and alſo for honeſt and Chriſtian recreation and delight, ſo farre, as his eſtate, and hers requireth, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities doe afford, and he muſt doe this willingly, liberally, and freely, not tarrying till it be begged, nor gotten ftom him by importunate entreatie, as of one ſhould wring it out of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> hand, like as if it were water out of a flint ſtone, for this is a great ſuſpition of want of loue. For loue is alwaies bountifull, and beſides that it leſſons the benefit by the one halfe, when it muſt be haled as it were by maine ſtrength from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt conſider, and before he be asked, prouide what he ſees neceſſarie for her, and what may be after a Chriſtian ſort delightfull vnto her, &amp; preuent her with the gift, euen as a father that loues his childe will not tarrie, till the child muſt come and beg &amp; apparell or meat but he doth caſt before hand how
<pb facs="tcp:29174:123"/> to helpe him, &amp; vnrequeſted giues him things that be needfull; much more then muſt he doe thus to his wife, which is the one part of himſelfe, and nearer, and ſhould be dearer alſo vnto him then any other.</p>
                  <p>A Second dutie wherein his due beneuolence muſt ſhew it ſelfe, is in giuing her due employment, he muſt obſerue and marke the gifts of wiſedome and gouernment, or what euer elſe God hath giuen her, that he may ſet them on worke and employ them. And hereby he ſhall ſhew his loue vnto her, and the confidence that he puts in her. For it is ſaid of a good wife in the <hi>Prouerbs. 31. That the heart of her husband truſts in her.</hi> And this is a meanes alſo to keepe her from diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and idlenes, and beſides it will turne to the great good and profit of the family. Which confutes the practiſe of many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh husbands, that be buſie bodies, and will haue all come through their hands; and there nothing goes well through any hand, becauſe of this diſordred confuſion, as if the Pilot would both hold the ſterne, and hoyſt vp the ſayle, and be vpon the hatches, and ſit vpon the neaſt and labour at the pumpe, and od all himſelfe, it muſt needs goe ill with the ſhip, and that is in continuall danger of ſinking. But thoſe gifts that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the wife, the husband muſt ſee them employed, and then ſhe ſhalbe a fellow-helper vnto him, and bring a bleſſing vpon the family by her labour.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the duties of husband and wife, which I doe not ſo ſpeake as though is were in the power or nature of any man or woman to performe theſe duties; nay, by nature men be inclined to the contrarie. The wife is naturally diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and ſtubborne, prone to conteme and diſpiſe her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he is prone to be wandring abroad, and take more delight in any ones company then his owne wiues, and if he be with her at any time, he is ſo deſtitute of all true ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as that he is readie alwaies to be eyther light or fooliſh, or elſe ſowre and churliſh, and to doe her hurt by his example and make her worſe rather then better, and both of them are deſtitute of all true and ſpirituall loue one of the other. But God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29174:123"/> ſhewes theſe duties in his word, to the end that we ſeeing our ſinnes and our weaknes, might bewaile our wants before God, and beſeech him that requires theſe things at our hands, to worke theſe things in our hearts: and as he hath giuen vs theſe good commandements, &amp; to giue vs grace to make our hearts good to keepe the commandements. And he that makes this vſe of the law, he profits by the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But if any be ſo blinde, and ſo vnacquainted with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of his owne heart, as that he dreame of ſome ſtrength in himſelfe, to doe theſe duties; it is certaine, he neuer did performe any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in truth, nor ſhall euer till he do lament his wants with vnfained griefe before God, &amp; deſire him to make him obedient, as well to giue him a charge of obedience.</p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning the duties of priuate perſons. As namely of parents and children, of maſters and ſeruants, of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife. The duties of publike perſons follow.</p>

                  <p>For the miniſter and people. It is euident that the miniſter is a father. It is plaine: 1. <hi>Cor. 4. Where Paule, though you haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teachers yet I haue begotten you vnto Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> cals <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his children, becauſe as their naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were inſtruments of God to beget them to a naturall life, ſo he was Gods inſtrument to beget him to a ſpirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Now the duties of the miniſter and people are eyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or ſpeciall.</p>
                  <p>The common duties which mutually belong to them both, are to pray one for another, and to giue thanks one for another. That the miniſter ought to pray for the people, the continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and practiſe of <hi>Paule</hi> almoſt in all his Epiſtles doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, as to the <hi>Philip. Coloſſ. Theſſ.</hi> for whom (he writes) <hi>that he giues thanks to God, and praies day and night for their encreaſe
<pb facs="tcp:29174:124"/> in all good graces.</hi> By <hi>Paules</hi> example, then miniſters muſt learne to pray to God in ſecret, for the flocke committed to their charge, that God would pardon all their ſinnes, and heale their natures, and make his doctrine effectuall, to worke grace and ſaluation in their hearts. And then if God haue heard his prayer, and bleſſed his preaching to conuert the hearts of his people, &amp; to ſaue their ſoules, he muſt not let this ſlip, but marke and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and returne thanks vnto God for it.</p>
                  <p>So 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. The people being affrighted with Gods fearefull ſigne and ſeeing their ſinnes, then they come vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the prophet of God, (as commonly it is the practiſe of men in time of proſperitie to ſet light by the miniſter, and not to regard him at all, but in time of aduerſitie where miſerie pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it is often ſeene, that men will ſend for him and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to heare him and craue his direction) ſo in affliction they come to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and earneſtly deſired him to pray for them. Then his anſwere is, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſinne againſt God, and ceaſe praying for you:</hi> ſhewing that it is a great ſinne againſt God in the miniſters if he be not frequent in prayer for his people. So that though the miniſter ſtudie diligently, preach painefully, and walke religiouſly, in all good conſcience; yet if he doe not pray to God, and beſeech him earneſtly to amend thoſe faults that he ſees in them, and to conuert their ſoules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and doe not alſo giue thanks when he perceiues any good thing wrought in them, and pray for the continuance and encreaſe of it, hee doth ſinne againſt God, and faile in a ſpeciall dutie that he owes to his charge. For all planting and watering is in vaine, vnleſſe God giue the encreaſe. And how can he reſpect any bleſſing of God, vnleſſe he doe both often and earneſtly ſeeke for it, and render moſt heartie thanks for it as he findes it granted?</p>
                  <p>For the people, that it is their dutie to pray to God, and be thankfull for their miniſter it is plaine. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. where this commaundement is giuen: <hi>Pray for vs, for we are aſſured that we haue a good conſcience &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> ſaith: <hi>That he hopes through their praiers to be giuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and 2. Theſ.</hi> 3. 1.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29174:124"/> 
                     <hi>He wils them to pray for him that he may haue free paſſage, and that he may be deliuered from vnreaſonable men.</hi> And to <hi>Timothie.</hi> 2. 1. he wils <hi>that prayers be made for all in authoritie,</hi> that as God hath ſet them ouer vs as gouernours, ſo he will gouerne their hearts, and order their proceedengs aright. This confutes thoſe people, that a long time haue liued vnder a minſtry, but all that ſpace cannot ſay that they haue once offered vp a true and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prayer to God for their paſtor, that he might be furniſhed with gifts for the faithfull diſcharge of ſo great and waightie an office, neuer ſpoken to God in his behalfe, to giue him a dore of vtterance to deliuer aright, and deuide the word of truth, to be with his meditations, and direct his tongue that he might to their conſciences, and for their edifying. And againe if at anie time God haue powred downe more plentifull grace vpon their miniſter, that he hath beene better ſtird vp to teach them, and hath ſpoken with more power and zeale then ordinarie, more earneſtly reprouing their ſinnes, and exhorting them to repentance; yet they take it but as an ordinarie thing, and let it paſſe without any notice, as though it were not any mercie of God to prepare the miniſters mouth to ſpeake to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And becauſe they be thus ſlacke in deſiring, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in thankſgiuing for ſo great a fauour, God doth iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of a great part of the bleſſing that haue careleſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great part of their dutie. So for the miniſters of the word, many be there that can ſay they haue preached many ſermons, and deliuered many doctrines and admonitions to their pariſioners; giuen them many good exhortations. But who of many can ſay as <hi>Ierome</hi> did, <hi>My ſoule ſhall weepe for you in ſecret;</hi> if publike preaching will not preuaile, I will trie what priuate weeping can doe, and if I cannot mooue them by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to them to amend, I will mooue God with many teares in ſecret to conuert them. And thus much for the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both. The particular follow.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of the people. The firſt thing that the people muſt performe to their miniſter, is to haue a tender and reuerent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. And this is commaunded 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. where
<pb facs="tcp:29174:125"/> the Apoſtle giues this in charge. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren know them that labor among you, and that are ouer you in the Lord, and admoniſh you that you haue them in ſinguler loue for their works ſake.</hi> as if he ſaid, I ſpeake not this ſo much for the miniſters ſake; for whether ye loue him or account of him, or not, ſo long as God accounts and eſteemes highly of him he is well; but I deſire you euen for your own good, that for thoſe faithfull men of God which labour amongſt you, to whom God hath giuen the ſpirit of grace and admonition, and whom God hath ſet to watch ouer your ſoules, let not them be forgotten and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected amongſt you, but take knowledge of them and obſerue them, and that for their works ſake. For in truth they of all men deſerue moſt to be regarded and accounted of, in regard of the profit that they bring, and the worke they performe, which howſoeuer it be not outward, and commonly brings no money to the purſe; Yet it is inward, and brings peace vnto the ſoule. For vnto them is committed the word of reconciliation and life, and they are made diſpoſers of the treaſures of God, that bring comfort and reioycing to the heart. If then they be meanes to giue <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> vnto you, if they helpe you to heauen, if they purge the ſoule, and build you vp in grace, if they beat downe ſinne, and ouerthrow the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in you, ought you not then to loue them, and that for their worke and your profits ſake?</p>
                  <p>But many there be that make no ſuch account of him, &amp; why? Becauſe they feele no ſuch neede of him, they ſee no neceſſitie of his labour, but that they may well ſpare him, they can ſee no good he doth; and no wonder, they can ſee none to whom nothing is good, but that which ſerues their fleſh. For as they account of him ſo they profit by him, and iuſt it is from God, that as they deſpiſe his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſo he ſhould them, and make them fruitleſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of that word, which to better men wants not a moſt excellent fruit, according as Chriſt hath ſaid: <hi>He that diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, diſpiſeth me, and he that diſpiſeth me, diſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:29174:125"/>
                  <p>If they diſpiſe God how can they reuerence the men of God? And hence it is that young vpſtart boyes and girles, in many places are growne to that top of impudencie and ſhameleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſinning and ſtanding for ſinne, as that they dare ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the miniſter of God, and oppoſe their life of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt his doctrine, and ſtand as ſtiffly for the diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God and the breach of the law of God, as he can ſtande for his law, whoſe life is nothing but a diſgracing of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, that in publique and veiw of all the world they might gainſay that in practiſe which he taught publiquely; and euen in the heat of the ſermon when the reproofe is yet freſh, and ſcarcely ended, then in the heat of their raging luſt, to fall to the thinge that was forbidden by God, and by his miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. But why comes fooliſh youth and boies to be thus impudent? But that they are animated by the froward example of elder perſons. As thoſe young children that mocked <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, how could they ſpeake ſo baſely and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly of the reuerende man of God, but that they heard ſuch thinges at home by their gouernours, and muſt needes vtter them when they come abroad. But was not this their bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe met with? Did not God paye them home though they were but children? for two beares came out of the woode and ſlew 40. of them. For when they dare profeſſe themſelues to be aduerſaries to the man of God and to the law of god, they muſt needes faile in euery other dutie, deſpiſing the perſon they muſt needes neglect the doctrine, and not reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the preacher, they cannot take good by his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
                  <p>The miniſter of god then ought to be eſteemed not according to his coats and wealth, which is the thing that fooliſh men doe only doat vppon, but according to the ſingular worke, and calling in which God hath ſette him; and which he will haue reſpected.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of the people is to obey the doctrine of the miniſter; elſe they be no faithfull keepers of the eight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, vnleſſe they make conſcience to yeelde obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:29174:126"/> to the doctrine of their miniſter taught truely out of the word of God. This is commanded <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that haue the ouerſight of you and ſubmit your ſelues. &amp;c.</hi> He wils them to obey their miniſters, namely in doctrine, and he addes the reaſon, becauſe they watch for your ſoule, ſith ye ſtand vpon their guarde to defend your ſoules from diſtruction; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubmit your ſelues, and obey not ſo much the men, as the doctrine and inſtruction deliuered out of Gods word in their calling. And ſecondly, if you doe not this, you ſhall be ſo farre from giuing ioy to the heart of your miniſter (which good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould doe) as that you ſhall peirce his ſoule with ſorrow, and be a meanes to eate vp his heattwith; for what greater an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh can come to the miniſters ſoule then this, that when he exhorts his people to holines they be vnholy, he teacheth them to be ſpiritually minded, and they be ſet altogether on the world, he ſhewes them that they muſt rule themſelues and families after the law of God, and follow their owne luſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this of all afflictions doth moſt wound &amp; breake the heart of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfull miniſter, that in loue to his flocke preacheth Gods word ſincerelie vnto them. I but would ſome ſay; what neede we care for his being agreeued? Nay, this is it that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſire, and wiſh nothing more then that, they knew how to vexe the miniſter. But ſaith he, make not ſo light account of greeuing the miniſter, for that is not profitable for you; he hath the ſorrow of it, but you the loſſe, he is driuen to runne oftner vnto God by your ill intreatie, and to ſeeke for the loue of god when men doe neglect them; but in the meane while, hee cannot with that ſpirit and courage pray to God for you, and ſo powerfully and cheerefully preach the word of God vnto you.</p>
                  <p>This confutes them that bragge of there good dealing with the miniſter, and thinkes they pay him all his dues as well as anie man, and takes it as a wrong that the miniſter eſteemes not of them as well as he doth of anie. But doe they performe their dutie? and what dutie is it they performe? doe they obey the goſpell which he preached and ſubmit themſelues to his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29174:126"/> doctrine; this is the heart of dutie, and where this is not, there is no dutie done worth thankes, leaſt they they conuerted, they do not pay the miniſter his due; for a faithfull paſtor and man of God regards not ſo much the tithes and lookes not to the fleece; he comes as Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter</hi> to bee a fiſher of men, and if they will not be drawne out of their luſts and ſinnes by his preaching, it is no dutie; for he that neglects obedience to the doctrine of the miniſtrie, is an ill ſheepe and vngodly perſon, ſhew what kindneſſe he will to the particular perſon of the miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The laſt dutie of the people to the miniſter is to performe maintainance vnto him both for his releefe and ſuſtenance, as alſo for his defence againſt the wronges of ill depoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For his releife and ſuſtenance that is commanded. <hi>Galat. 6. 6. Let him that is taught in the worde make him that haih taught him partaker of all his goods, bee not deceiued God is not mocked &amp;c.</hi> Where willing them that are taught to prouide for the maintainance of the miniſter, he meetes with common corruption of men, that thinke all is gotten, that they can couſen and deceiue the miniſter of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carnall men are neuer more wittie in anie thinge then in withholding his dues, but he ſaith be not deceiued. As if he had ſaid, you thinke to deceiue an other, but indeed you ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach your ſelfe; your ſelues bee deceiued at the length; for though this cunning dealing may happilie be hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from men, and done ſo cloſely that it ſhall not bee knowne, yet GOD will not be thus mocked, hee ſees and knowes mens fetches well enough, tis noe colouring with him that ſearcheth the hearts.</p>
                  <p>For if you deale thus wrongfully, make an account that as you ſowed ſo you ſhall reape, ſuch as your ſeede time was, ſuch ſhall be your harueſt, this your corrupt and vniuſt dealing ſhall get but a ſorrie reward, and ſuch as ſhall bring but ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your ſelues; and in an other place the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>if they giue ſprituall thinges, is it a great matter that they receiue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and thoſe that ſerue at the altar liue by the altar. So that
<pb facs="tcp:29174:127"/> it is the peoples dutie, freely and without grudging to helpe the miniſter with ſufficient allowance for matters of this life.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they muſt giue him maintenance againſt the wronges of bad men as it is noted of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> that they ſtood for <hi>Paule,</hi> and that was not a thing that hee alone was bound to be thankefull to them for, but in ſo doing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued thankes of the whole Church, which receiued good by his miniſtrie. And if this dutie were carefully performed, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters would not be ſo bolde and audatious to moleſt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the miniſters and faithfull men of God as they be. But it comes oft ſo to paſſe, that though the miniſter be in all things faithfull to his power, and beare ſuch a loue vnto his people, as that he would part with his bloud to doe them good; yet let but ſome vilde perſon of a wicked and vngodly life, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the diuell neuer lackes ſuch inſtruments, to vexe Gods miniſters,) let ſome but baſe limme of the diuell ſtep forth to ſet him ſelfe againſt the miniſter and to perſecute him, manie in the congregation will be readie to ioyne with him, and haue their hand in as deepe as any. But others of the better ſort haue no courage to ſtand for him, and to defend his good cauſe; many thinke they doe not breake the fifth commandement, and yet know that God hath ſaid, that <hi>he that laboureth in doctrine is worthy of double honour.</hi> Yet when will they ſpeake well of the miniſter, when will they open their mouth in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? but are readie to ſay it was his indiſcretion, hee was to haſtie and vnaduiſed, he might haue kept himſelfe quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus either becauſe they be daſtardly and dare not, or malicious and will not, allmoſt none can be founde, that will ſtande in the maintenance of their faithfull miniſter, againſt the furie and malice of the Diuell and his limmes wicked perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                  <p>But this is a moſt ſoule fault, for if any had a good friend to whom he were much beholding, and of whom he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many benefites, no man almoſt is ſo cowardly and baſe minded, but if he heard one raile vpon him and abuſe him, he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29174:127"/> would take courage to ſpeake for him, and for his credite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but who almoſt can be found, of many in a pariſh, that can afford a good word for the Miniſter; nay, are not moſt of this minde, that if he be moleſted all is loſt that fals beſide. Thus much for the dueties of the people; the Miniſters particular dueties fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, to be a good example and patterne vnto them in loue, in faith, in patience and in euery good duetie, as 1. <hi>Tim. 4. 12. Let no man diſpiſe thy youth.</hi> I but, (might <hi>Timothy</hi> ſay,) can I keepe them from deſpiſing my youth? I cannot hinder it, yet, <hi>Shew thy ſelfe an example to thoſe that beleeue.</hi> This then is commanded as a duetie that gaines the Miniſter great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and account in the heartes of his people, and keepes him from contempt, that the light of God ſhine forth in him, and they may ſee the graces of the holy Ghoſt in his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therfore the Apoſtle ſheweth how he muſt gouerne his ſeruants, and order his children and his whole houſhold, els, if he lay loade of doctrine vpon others and do nothing him ſelfe, they may ſay, <hi>Phiſition heale thy ſelf, and pull out the beame out of thine owne eye thou hypocrite:</hi> &amp; this will make all his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching fruiteles &amp; vaine, for he that cannot gouerne himſelfe &amp; his owne family, how is it poſſible he ſhould order his flocke aright? Therefore he muſt ſhew his firſt skill in gouerning him ſelfe and his familie, and thoſe that be neereſt vnto him.</p>
                  <p>The next duetie of the Miniſter, is to preach the pure word of God in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, to feed the flocke diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully, to intend and take heede to ſuch wholeſome doctrine as may nouriſh the ſoules of his people, to deuide the word of trueth aright, to ſpeak to the capacitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his people, in all diligence &amp; faithfulnes, not making marchandiſe of the word and Goſpel of Chriſt, that ſo his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be prepared, as a fit and pure Virgin to marrie Chriſt, and ſo farre as he doth theſe things, that in doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he goe before his flocke, he may looke for duetie at their hand, or if they performe it not, yet he may ſay, <hi>my reward is with God and my recompence with the moſt high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:128"/>
                  <p>Thus much for thoſe ſuperiours that haue authoritie in the Church and their inferiours. The ſuperiors and inferiors in the Common wealth follow, and thoſe are Magiſtrate and people.</p>
                  <p>The firſt duetie of the ſubiect, is inward and outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in heart to reuerence, and outwardly to obey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtate as is commaunded. <hi>Rom. 13. Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higheſt powers.</hi> He commands not onely a bodily ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be in the moſt rebellious perſons that reſiſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and lie open to the curſe of God for this ſinne: but a ſubmiſſion inward of the ſoule, as vnto a ſparke of Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and an appointment, or if this inward be not firſt, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubiection will faile vpon euery light occaſion. There muſt be an outward ſubiection alſo, in obeying their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo farre as they command lawfull things. As <hi>Titus 3. 1. Put them in remembrance that they be ſubiect to all in authoritie, and obedient.</hi> But if it ſo fall out that the Prince, or any inferiour Magiſtrate command things vnlawfull, againſt the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God; then indeed one muſt with <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay, <hi>It is better to obey God then man.</hi> But yet ſo, as one be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring or reſiſtance, to beare with euery puniſhment ſhall be layd vpon him, euen to death. As <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the king made a wicked Edict, would not yeelde vnto it, but yet he was content to yeelde to the puniſhment with patience, and neuer went about to gather a power in his owne defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king. And the three Children, would not preferre <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> commandements before Gods, but yet they did not by rebellion ſeeke their owne deliuerance, but quietly gaue vp themſelues to death, expecting helpe onely from God. So that if the Magiſtrates command be lawfull, the ſubiect muſt obey; but if he command an vnlawfull thing, he muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, but ſuffer the puniſhment without murmuring, euen in heart: as <hi>Eccle. 16. 20. Curſe not the king, no not in thine heart, nor the rich in thy bed chamber, for the foules of the ayre ſhall diſcrie it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the king or any in authoritie vnder him doe thee wrong, yet allowe noe miſcheiuous and wicked thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29174:128"/> them, for if thou doe God will bring it to light. But if the king be vniuſt and wicked, then wee muſt pray to God to conuert him, as <hi>Paule</hi> commands <hi>Tim.</hi> that as our ſinnes haue brought an ill gouernour ouer vs, ſo our prayers may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue him, or better him. This the firſt dutie then, is ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without gainſaying.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is to pay their due willingly and freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>tribute to whome tribute, cuſtome to whome cuſtome,</hi> and not euery paiments elſe are neceſſarie for the maintaynance of their ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly that they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to repreſſe rebels and enemies, and partly that hauing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent maintainance from the peoples coſt, they may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, but may bend their whole indeuour to good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and protection of the people.</p>
                  <p>The duties of the magiſtrate follow; for he hath his charge to, and much is required of him to whome much is giuen. Firſt then, his dutie is to looke to godlineſſe, that religion and pure worſhip of God be confirmed and maintained in his land, as 1. <hi>Tim. 2. 2. Paule wills to pray for theſe in authoritie that we may liue a godly life vnder them. And now that which we muſt pray to God for.</hi> that they may doe, is their dutie to doe. Firſt then a magiſtrate according to the authoritie of his place muſt haue a care of godlineſſe, and looke that the pure worſhip of God be ſet vp, and all falſe and idolatrous worſhip ſuppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed. And thus did the godly and chriſtian kinge in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and others whoſe firſt and eage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt worke was to pull downe all idols, and to exhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their people to practiſe the pure and holy worſhippe of GOD according to his worde; and where this is not doone, the duties of the ſeconde Table muſt needes bee neglected.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of the magiſtrate is to maintaine peace and quietnes, to prouide for the vnity and concord of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as in the ſame place of <hi>Timothie,</hi> that we may liue a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peaceable and a quiet life. Nowe they may prouide for peace by pulling downe and repreſſing the wicked with their
<pb facs="tcp:29174:129"/> authoritie, as alſo by maintaining and defending the innocent and rewarding the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for vnleſſe the magiſtrate declare his ſtrenght and ſhew his authoritie againſt ſinners, they will be practiſing and ſtirring againſt Gods children, the Serpent will nibble at the Heele, darkeneſſe will hate light, and the dogs will be wurrying the ſheepe; the diuell driues them and needs they muſt be troubleſome, as he their captaine is, for an ill conſcience is feirce, and hauing not the peace of God to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et them, they cannot be quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what way muſt be taken then? the Magiſtrate muſt make them quiet, by ſhewing them the edge of the ſworde, he muſt hamper them, and let them ſee that if they be troubleſome it ſhall be to their owne coſt, they ſhall trouble themſelues, and this will ſome thinge bridle them that good men may haue ſome reaſonable peace by them.</p>
                  <p>The third dutie of Magiſtrates is to procure honeſtie, as in the ſame place of <hi>Timothie</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeakes. Nowe this they muſt doe by remouing all lewd practiſes and perſons and thoſe thinges that are occaſions to them, as ſtewes and houſes of filtheneſſe, as houſes of gamning, which are meanes to prouoke men to much luſt and vnthriftineſſe, contrarie to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honeſtie, and good manners. Theſe things the Magiſtrates muſt reforme ſo farre as his authoritie will ſtretch, or elſe hee is not faithfull in his place. And this was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Aſa</hi> that hee putte the Sodomites out of the land.</p>
                  <p>An other point of honeſtie is to take order about the poore in a good honeſt ſort. Firſt, for rogues and runnagates that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong and luſtie, make begging and wandring their trade of life, that they be ſeuerely puniſhed and ſet to worke.</p>
                  <p>That no maintenance or allowance be giuen vnto them, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that will not worke, let him not eate.</hi> And what more diſhoneſt thing in a Chriſtian commonwealth, then that ſuch men ſhould be permitted which pollute the ayre, and fill the land with ſinne? making their whole life nothing elſe but a continuall practiſe of filthines, theft, and idlenes, ſonnes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that liue without a calling, without a magiſtracie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29174:129"/> without a miniſterie. That neyther glorifie God, nor ſerue the prince, not profit the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, but are an vnſpeakable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the earth, &amp; blot to the ſtate, as droanes liuing on other mens labours, and the ſweat of other mens browes. Theſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie perſons, this curſed and vngodly ofspring, and vnprofitable generation, this droſſe of the land, refuſe and of ſcouring of the world, muſt be purged away by the hand of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in whom hand there is power, and to whom God hath for this entent committed the ſword that they cut off or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch rotten braunches. And this the excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie example of <hi>Iob</hi> ſufficiently confirmes, who though he was aboundant in mercie, and in all libertie to the poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whoſe neceſſitie not idleneſſe made them ſtand in need of his helpe, ſo that he was an eye to the blind, (as euery good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate eſpecially, ought to be) and a foot to the lame &amp;c. yet for theſe wicked perſons, he ſo hated their ſonnes, and ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed their perſons, as that they had rather flie to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and embrace the rockes, lye among the buſhes, and eate the Iuniper rootes, then be ſeene in that place where <hi>Iob</hi> had any thing to doe, or come within the limits of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, yea ſo infamous where they growen, that men ſhouted at them as at a theefe, and they were almoſt quite baniſhed from the company of men. And he giues this reaſon, they were villaines and the ſonnes of villaines, more baſe and vilde, then the earth which they tread vpon; this ſentence the holy Ghoſt giues of theſe yong and luſtie roguing vagrants. But one might ſay be they not men, and beare Gods image? Nay ſaith he, they haue ſo defaced Gods Image, as that they be not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the dogs of my flocke; the dogs of the flock doe good in defending the ſheepe, but theſe are good for nothing but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and ſtaine and defile the land with all filthineſſe and whordome.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe whom God hath made the head and hands of the commonwealth, muſt ioyne their endeauour together, to root out the race of vngodly and vilde perſons. Which ſome time agone was by wholeſome and good lawes ſomthing well
<pb facs="tcp:29174:130"/> redreſſed among vs; but now through the negligence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour magiſtrates, and fooliſh pittie in not executing theſe lawes, they begin to reuiue afreſh, and if the wiſer care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of magiſtrates in higher place be not, will take head again to the ſhame of them, &amp; the hurt of the whole commonwealth. Therefore as they will haue a care to performe their owne duty, and wipe away their owne ſhame, and heale manifold euils of the commonwealth, and hinder manifold foule ſinnes amongſt men, and eſtabliſh a chiefe point of honeſtie in and by their gouernment, they muſt ſweepe away this filth of the earth, and ſo, that no allowance or maintenance be giuen vnto them; for the onely mercie to ſuch is to helpe them out of their ſinne by puniſhment, and a great note of friendſhip and loue to God and the commonwealth is to amend or cut of thoſe that be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies to both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for ſuch as are impotent, and by reaſon eyther of age or weakneſſe, or want of limmes cannot labour, or elſe if they haue ſtrength and vſe of it, cannot earne ſo much as to maintaine them and their family; they muſt be helped by the prouident care of the magiſtrate, and chriſtian orders for that caſe, that they be not conſtrained to beg their bread; for it is a moſt diſhoneſt and baſe thing, to ſee men ſtand whining at the doore like dogs for bread, and this corrupts their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and is contrarie to all good nature, and deſtroyes the ſeeds of any good diſpoſition in them, feſtring the minde with idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and drawing a thicke skinne of impudence ouer their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Therefore to preuent theſe euils and hurts, the wiſe and mercifull diligence of the magiſtrate muſt take order for their timely and chriſtian reliefe. And thus much for ſuperiours with authoritie. The ſuperiours without authoritie follow, and their inferiours and thoſe are eyther</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>in Giftes. Or Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The duties of thoſe that are inferiour to others in gifts, is firſt to acknowledge it, and reuerence them for their gifts. If God beſtowed vpon any one more godlineſſe, more wiſedom, more diſcretion or vnderſtanding, though he haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29174:130"/> yet, he hath an excellencie &amp; ſuperioritie aboue thoſe which haue not equall gifts; and this they muſt acknowledge to Gods glory, and reuerence him that God hath honoured. Elſe they clip the Lords coyne, and deface his image, if whom God hath graced with the ſpirit of wiſedome and counſell, with grace and power ouer their affections, and ſuch like; they by obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, ſo farre as they can, hinder the glorie of God, and the good fruit that might come by them. They muſt then with reuerence be acknowledged. And thus the woman of Canaan that at firſt reſted with Chriſt, at length perceiuing his giftes, acknowledgeth him to be a Prophet (for ſo farre onely ſhe ſaw then,) and deales more reuerently with him. And <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Daniel</hi> was endued with wiſedome and knowledge from God to expound dreams, more then he or any of his nobles, doth confeſſe this, and reuerence him for it. But contrary is their practiſe, which through enuy &amp; pride, ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to depraue or to leſſen other mens grace, &amp; think no gifts worth looking after but their owne, and iudge all men fooles beſides themſelues. Yet they thinke it a dutie that other men ſhould acknowledge their outward gifts, as wealth and ſuch like, and reuerence them for it, as indeed they ought with a ciuil reuerence for peace ſake, but no man is bound to thinke better of them for their wealth ſake; and why then do not they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues confeſſe the inward gifts beſtowed vpon others which are much more excellent?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of inferiours in gifts, is to make a good vſe of the gifts that others haue beyond them, imitating the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and patience that they ſee in them, taking direction, and crauing counſell at his wiſedome and vnderſtanding, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence theſe graces in another, ſo to labour for them in themſelues, as it were to light their candle at his, and to draw ſome few drops from his ful bucket. Thus the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Canaan ſo ſoone as ſhe perceiued Chriſt to be an other maner of perſon then ſhe thought, ſhe left of ieſting, and fell to aske him ſome queſtions of religion, that ſhe might be the better for meeting with a prophet. And <hi>Pharo</hi> perceiuing <hi>Ioſephs</hi> wiſedome and
<pb facs="tcp:29174:131"/> prouident foreſight, put him in ſuch place where his good might procure the common good. And <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Daniels</hi> fitneſſe for an high place of office, preferd him where he might put his wiſedome &amp; other graces to the proofe and practiſe. And this effect will manifeſt that one doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and reuerence the gifts of others, elſe all ſhewe of accounting of them is but hypocriticall, and ſhall yeelde no comfort to the ſoule afterwards. This ſhames and reprooues them that one may ſpeake many graue and godly ſpeaches in their hearing, before they learne any piece of one to follow it, how manie examples of patience and holineſſe and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may they ſee in a good man, and yet be neuer a whitte the better for it? God hath giuen ſo many graces for their good, and will they be better by none of them? that is a ſoule faulte, and it ſhewes that in truth their is no true reuerence, for that which one eſteemes and accounts of in an other, he would bee very deſirous, to be partaker of it himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Superiours in gifts, they muſt do this (for all duties in this commandement are mutuall) they muſt turne their gifts to the beſt good of others, vſe their wiſdome to direct, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to inſtruct, their ſtrength to beare burthens as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>you that are ſtrong,</hi> What? we muſt not lay burthens vpon the weake to ſuppreſſe them, but <hi>beare the burthens of the weake,</hi> to helpe them. Vnleſſe therefore hee to whom God hath giuen more graces then ordinarie, doe vſe that which he hath receiued to the glorie of him that gaue it, and to the good of mankind for which he gaue it, he is found an abuſer of the Lords talents, which gaue them him; not that he ſhould vaine gloriouſly ſet himſelfe aboue others that want them, and ſo tread his inferiours vnder foot, or cruelly oppreſſe, or crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumuent and deceiue thoſe of meaner capacitie then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but to the common good of the whole Church, and the further edification of the weaker; that as he hath receiued more, then ſo according to the number of his talents he might bring forth a greater encreaſe. But for one to grow proude, and ſet himſelfe aboue others, that brings the curſe of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29174:131"/> him, and is the next way to make him deſpiſed, and to looſe his gifts which he can vſe no better. As it is ſeene by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in a greater number, that God had furniſhed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gifts both of bodie and minde, ſo that there was great hope that they ſhould haue much ſet forth the glorie of God, and done much good to the Church of God. When they began once to lift vp themſelues and ſeeke their owne vaineglorie more then Gods glorie, and ſo haue turned their giftes the wrong way, themſelues haue growne in contempt, and thoſe graces which they haue had, haue rotted away, and by little &amp; little came to nothing. And iuſt it is with God that it ſhould be ſo, for that man which will not honour God with his gifts God will ſee that he ſhall haue no honour, and better that they and their gifts ſhould periſh, then they ſhould haue them to doe no good, but ſet vp themſelues. Thus much for ſuperiours and inferiours in gifts. Theſe in age follow.</p>
                  <p>The dueties of younger perſons to the ancient is to ſhew a reuerent opinion of them, and to ſhew all reuerent and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue behauiour vnto them, in reſpect that they carry vpon them as it were a print of Gods eternitie: which is commaunded, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 32. to riſe vp before the hoare head, and honour the perſon of the aged. <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> Where giuing this commaundement of honouring the aged, he meets with yong conceited heads by this reaſon, I am the Lord, to whom thou oweſt obedience, I will haue it thus, and in this reſpect it were the beſt way for thee to yeeld obedience. So <hi>Iſay.</hi> 3. 5. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a curſe of God and a plague that comes with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the commonwealth, when ſuch wofull confuſion ſhould take place, as that young boyes and children of no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or gouernment ſhould preſume againſt, and proud young youthes that haue no grace, nor any thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, that neuer did good, that none can ſay that the world is the better for them, it might haue done as well if they neuer had beene borne, that ſuch proud abſurd perſons ſhould grow to that extremitie of impudencie and ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to preſume againſt their betters, and preferre
<pb facs="tcp:29174:132"/> themſelues before their elders. Which doth ſharpely alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the cuſtomable rudeneſſe of our youth that no whit regard their elders; To ſhew any token of reuerence to them, in riſing before them, or vncouering, but go &amp; vſe ſuch behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our with them as if it were with fellow, boyes, or playfellowes.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of the elder perſons is to giue a good example. For a grey head is a glorie if it be found in the way of grace if they be godly and holy, and ſhew a graue, wiſe, and graue conuerſation; then eyther younger perſons ſhall giue them their due reuerence, or if they doe not, the ſinne lyes vpon their owne heads, and they be blameleſſe. So <hi>Titus. 2. 2. The elder muſt be ſober, honeſt, diſcreet, ſound in the faith, in loue, and patience,</hi> as their bodie decayes, ſo their ſoules muſt encreaſe in all grauitie and ſoberneſſe; and for their vnſound limmes and weake, they muſt get a ſtrong and ſound fayth, that by the long continuance of time, and often vſe of the meanes of ſaluation, they muſt get great ſoundneſſe and power of faith, which may worke aboundantly in them by the fruits of loue which alwaies accompanies true faith; and this loue will make them patient, not forward, not pettiſh, not eaſie to be offended, but full of long ſuffering, to be an example to others of meekneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But contrarie it is in thoſe, whoſe ſinnes of their youth haue ſtayned them ſo deeply, and ſo filled their bodies, as there is no grace to be ſeene in their olde age. Their words are altogether vaine, and light, fooliſh, nothing ſauouring of grace, ſo that no man can in reuerence, eyther craue aduiſe from them or be ſilent to heare ſuch fooliſh and vnſauerie talke, as cuſtomably comes from them, and their conuerſation full of teſtineſſe and vnaduiſed wrath, and bloted with miſerable and abiect couetouſneſſe and greedineſſe, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſmelling earthward, and purſuing the world ſwiftly, when they can ſcarce go vp and downe in the world. No grace no wiſdome, nor any vertue bewtifieth their grey haires, theſe want, and that iuſtly their honour, becauſe they haue the firſt ſteppe olde age, but they want the vpſhot and perfection to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29174:132"/> be found in the way of grace. And thus much for the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuperiours and inferiours commaunded in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is next: <hi>That thy daies may be long in the land which the Lord thy god giueth thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is taken from the good effect and commoditie that will follow to him that keepes this commaundement. It ſhall be for his profit, he ſhall haue the benefit of it himſelfe. So that hence we may learne this leſſon, that the way to get a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and long life, is to be obedient to parents and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and to honour them. As in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. He ſaith this is a commaundement with promiſe, namely, with a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. For indeed this ſtirs vp the heart of the parent to pray to God for his children, that he would poure a bleſſing on them, and that not in word onely, but indeed, and in the deſire of his ſoule, he will beg it earneſtly at Gods hand, for ſo the wordes in the originall runne that they may prolong thy daies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thy parents, when they ſhall haue occaſion with a glad and ioyfull heart to thanke God for that comfort which they haue receiued by the obedience and dutifulneſſe of their children; this brings with it a bleſſing of God vpon the ſoule and bodie of ſuch a childe to prolong his life in all happineſſe. But on the other ſide when the father and mother through the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and obſtinacie of a childe are driuen to ſigh and mourne before God with a troubled ſoule, that hee that ſhould haue bene one of the greateſt comforts is one of the greateſt griefes, and he that ſhould haue built vp the houſe doth pluck it down; this brings a curſe, and prouokes God to cut of his life vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his ſoule alſo (vnleſſe he repent) to his damnation. An example of this we haue in the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab. Ierem.</hi> 35. 19. They did reuerence their parents ſo much, and had ſuch a regard of him, as that when he ſeeing the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue abuſe of wine to drunkenneſſe, and the abuſe of lands and houſes to couetous greedineſſe, commanded them to drink no wine nor build no houſes, nor buy no land, which might ſeeme an hard commandement, abridging them of their pleaſure and
<pb facs="tcp:29174:133"/> profit; yet in loue to their father, they kept it all their daies faithfully. Now God he comes vpon the Iſraelites, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes them by the example of <hi>Ionadabs</hi> ſonnes; ſhewing that he had beene a better father vnto them, then <hi>Ionadab</hi> had beene to his ſonnes, and his commandements reſtrained them from no lawfull delight, but onely from ſin that would damne the ſoule, yet they would not be ſo obedient to him as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> to their father. Therefore in the laſt place he comes to giue a reward to the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab ſhall neuer want a man to ſtand before me.</hi> Such a good thing, and ſo acceptable is it vnto God, that children ſhould ſubmit themſelues vnto their ſuperiours. And ſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hauing beene a good ſonne to <hi>Iacob, Iacob</hi> prolonged his daies; for he prayed ſo heartily for him, that God could not denie. Alwaies when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> came, then <hi>Iacobs</hi> mouth was full of bleſſings and he was ſo nimble to pray for him with his whole hart, as that he could haue powred out his ſoule in a prayer for him to haue done him good, and theſe did not goe into the ayre, and vaniſh fruitleſſely, but tooke place, and God indeed bleſſed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in himſelfe, &amp; his poſteritie aboundantly. So that the beſt diet, and the beſt ayre that one can liue in, to make children haue a long and happie life is to be obedient to their parents. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let children learne to be dutifull, and to ſerue their parents; as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Timothie</hi> did ſerue him as a ſonne ſerueth his father, ſo that a good childe ſhould be his fathers beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. This doing they ſhall bring Gods bleſſing vpo their ſoules and bodie, otherwiſe they ſhall haue a ſhort life, and a miſerable life, alwaies in bondage to ſome foule luſt or other that ſhall play the tyrant ouer them, and reuenge their parents quarrell vpon them.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues alſo ſecondly to inſtruct parents that if they would haue it goe well with their children, they muſt not then ſo much labour to get great matters in the world for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to take them downe by time, to inſtruct them and narture them in godlineſſe, and to labour to bring obedience and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into their hearts; or els be they as greate as they will they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29174:133"/> ſhall bring a curſe vpon them. As we ſee in <hi>Dauid</hi> ſonnes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was negligent in bringing them vp in the feare of God, but let them haue their owne way, and could not find in his heart for fooliſh fondneſſe to correct them, we ſee how Gods curſe purſues them; one commites inceſt, the other ſeeing <hi>Dauid</hi> would not puniſh ſo ſoule a ſinne, vſurps authoritie and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his brothers iudge and executioner, and after alſo driues his father out of his kingdome and ſeekes his life, till he died a miſerable death and a ſtrange, Gods hand taking vengeance on his wickedneſſe. An other by treaſonable practiſes came to death by his brother iuſtly. So all theſe came to a violent and fearefull end, why? becauſe he would not reproue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor checke them as is noted. but for <hi>Solomon,</hi> his father inſtructed him &amp; his mother inſtructed him, he was kept in, &amp; not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to runne after vanitie ſo, and therefore we ſee what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings befell to him, &amp; what a curſe ouertooke the reſt. So <hi>Eli</hi> for fooliſh pittie grew ſo tender, that hee would not correct his children according as he ought, therefore miſerie came vpon himſelfe and both they died in a day. Therefore as parents may and muſt deſire an happie and longe life for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo they muſt alſo vſe the meanes to get it for them, by good nurture, and maſtring them to make them know and doe their dutie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for better parents maſter them by correction, then God deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in indignation; for if they be not ſtaid at firſt, they will proceede from rebellion againſt parents, to rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt magiſtrates, and then they will rebell againſt god alſo till he cut them of by diſtruction.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues alſo for the comfort of dutifull children who happily can ſee nothing but pouertie, and are deſtitute of all worldly meanes of helpe.</p>
                  <p>But let them not looke on the outſide ſo much, turne to the inſide a little; how haue they behaued themſelues to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, how haue they dealt with them, what affections haue they carried toward them, what good haue they beene willing to doe for them, what obedience haue they ſhewed them? Make account then that God will bleſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſuccour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:134"/> that they ſhall liue a long and happie life vpon the earth. And it is iuſt that their children alſo ſhould reward the like to them, to couer their infirmities as <hi>Noahs</hi> chrildren did, ſo that either God will not let them breake out, or elſe they ſhall hide them and not lay them open to their ſhame. But thoſe that be now ſo rebellious as they be ſicke of the father or mother, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the parents landes more then their life; Looke for it, a daye will come that they ſhall bee ſicke of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to.</p>
                  <p>But here ſeemes an obiection to ariſe. We ſee it far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ofttimes, vilde perſons liue long and thoſe that bee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient die quickely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to this we may anſwere, that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate liues but to heape vp wrath againſt the day of wrath, and to make vp a greaer meaſure of his ſinnes, that God may make vp a greater meaſure of vengeance; ſo that the greateſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for reprobates were to dye ſo ſoone as they were borne; for the longer they liue the more ſins they commit, and the more ſhalbe their torments. For the godly if God take them away ſooner, it is to take them to a better place, that they may be taken from the euill to come. As the one good ſonne of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> died younge, to the intent that hee might not be infected with the foule ſinnes of his fathers houſe, if hee ſhould haue beene longer among them, and alſo that he might not be afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the fight of thoſe fearefull iudgements that were to fall vpon his fathers houſe. And this is no ill bargaine, to bee taken from earth to heauen, from the battaile to the victory, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man to God, and the companie of his Angels and Saints.</p>

                  <p>In that he ſaith, God giues them this land; This we learne, that all good thinges are the gifts of God, as the people of god ſay in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> the ſword and bowe did not bring them into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> but the word of God, and his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> to giue that land to him and his ſeede for euer. So that God giues poſſeſſions and inheritances not wit nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. God ſaith he gaue the Edomits, Ammonites, and the Moabites their poſſeſſion, and he did caſt out greate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29174:134"/> giants, they thought it had beene their valure, but God ſaith it was his gift, for elſe they could not haue ſtood before thoſe huge and waſt gyants. And he ſaith they ſhall haue it ſtill. So that God both puts and keepes men in poſſeſſion. For he gaue them power, and then giants could not keepe them out. So in the <hi>Pſal. The earth is the Lords,</hi> and he giues a reaſon, he hath made it, and founded it on the waters, all men in the world can make nothing and when is it made they haue no power to preſerue it; becauſe therefore God only can create and make theſe thinges he is the only true honour of them. And though he ſometime put man in poſſeſſion, yet he neuer puts himſefe out, but he will haue the diſpoſing of all; No man hath the fee ſimple of his life, the beſt tenure is tenant at will, and if god call the ſoule, it muſt not take day with him.</p>
                  <p>Sith then the earth is the Lords, and he is the right owner of it, this vſe we muſt make of it; thankefully to acknowledge whence wee receiue all theſe thinges that we enioy. And men will ſay why? Who is ſo ſimple but he knowes and confeſſeth that God giues him all thinges? In word it is true, all moſt none but will ſay ſo, yet indeede and in practiſe how many be there which denie it and say the contrarie? For where there is a true &amp; heartie perſwaſion, that God doth freely beſtow all things, and we haue them of his gift; Theſe two thinges will alwaies followe. Firſt, ſuch a one ſo far as he is thus perſwaded will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be proud, for he can ſay to himſelf, what haſt thou that thou haſt not receiued? and then he will be the more humble rather, when he knowes that he is more indebted to God, and hath a greater reckoning to giue; For all ſwelling proceedes from hence that a man thinkes that he is behoulding to no body but himſelfe. Secondly, he that in truth of heart confeſſeth hee hath it from God, will vſe that he hath to Gods glorie. Elſe if one will ſay. Why I know that, what neede you tell me that I haue my wealth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God? I know it well enough. But how doe you vſe it, to ſerue your owne luſt; ſo that you thinke it nothing to beſtow twentie pound vpon your filthie luſt, but cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a pennie to a poore chriſtian, to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> then you
<pb facs="tcp:29174:135"/> are a deepe diſſembling hipocrite. For why doth God giue you ſo large wages but that you ſhould doe him the better ſeruice? and why hath the ſteward his maſters mony but to lay it out for his maſters profit? elſe if a ſtewarde ſhould ſay, I haue the keeping of an hundreth or two of pounds, but it is all my maſters and not mine, but yet he will ſpende it frankely in gamning or riotouſneſſe, then he is eitheir a diſſembler and thinkes not that it is his maſters though he ſay ſo, or elſe he is a theefe that will lauiſh his maſters goods ſo vnthriftily. But in truth the ill vſe of goods ſhewes, that moſt men in their hearts, ſay of their goods as the Atheiſts in the 12. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> ſay of their tongues, <hi>our tongues are ours and wee will ſpeake.</hi> And they ſay our wealth is ours and wee will doe with it what our luſt.</p>
                  <p>But it is not yours, when did you purchaſe it of God, when paide you any price to him for it? Where was the bargaine ſealed? What? is God ſhut vp within the clouds and cooped in heauen, that he hath nothing to doe with the earth? Nay, but time will come that they ſhall know to their greefe, that the earth is the Lords, though he for a while hath permitted the vſe of it to the ſonnes of men. Therefore let them learne to vſe God as a landlord, &amp; let not their luſt be the maſter of the lords goods.</p>
                  <p>This ſerues alſo for the terror of thoſe that abuſe the good benefits of God to his diſhonour. God will certainly turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out. Or if he doe keepe them in, it ſhall be but as in a priſon. They ſhall not haue the vſe of theſe things by the vertue of the couenant, that they may ſay as it is heere ſaid, the Lord thy God hath giuen thee theſe and theſe things; but thus they may ſay the Lord thine enemie hath permitted thee to haue theſe and theſe things. <hi>Iudas</hi> could not ſay the lord my God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me this monie, But the Lord mine enemie hee permitted me to haue it. And ſo it is with all ſuch as abuſe Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they come not in mercie as bleſſings as fauours out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but they come as curſes to harden the heart, to make them proud or couetous, and more ſtrong to follow their luſt.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly this ſerues for the comfort of Gods true children and faithfull ſeruants. That ſith God giues all thinges, therefore ſurely they ſhall want nothing that is good for them; for hee himſelfe ſaith, <hi>it is not good to giue the chlidrens breade to dogges;</hi> and ſhall we thinke then that he will doe it? Doth God feede the ſwine and will he ſtarue his children? And therefore that which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times they take as a diſcourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that vile Atheiſts prophane blaſphemers, and filthie drunken ſwaggerers haue mony to ſpare and carrie a ſway, when they be in miſerie pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with want and neceſſitie; This ſhould be a great encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrengthning to their faith. For be the dogs kept thus fatte and well liking, ſure then the children though they haue not thinges ſuperfluous to make them wanton, yet ſhall not be debard of thinges neceſſarie, to driue them into want. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord is our habitation, the Lord is food and apparell &amp;c. And theſe things they haue by vertue of Gods couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; as teſtimonies of Gods loue &amp; therefore though they be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo large, yet a little thing that the righteous hath, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the troubleſome abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wicked; for they may ſay, the Lord our God hath giuen vs theſe thinges. Therefore if God be true and iuſt, if he be the Lord of heauen and earth, if they caſt themſelues and their truſt vpon him, hee will caſt all thinges good and neceſſarie vpon them in the due and fitte time; or if they haue ſome outwarde wantes, they ſhall bee recompenced with inwarde and better comforts.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>hat the thinges of omiſſion be that are forbidden concerning the bodie it may appeare in <hi>Math.</hi> 15. Where Chriſt condemnes ſome as goates, limmes of the diuell, and firebrands of hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they gaue not meate to hungrie, and drinke to the thirſtie, and clothed not the naked and viſited not the ſicke and impriſoned, and ſuch like. So that the omitting of theſe duties of mercie, is an inditement ſtronge enough to bring ſuch perſons to hell. And <hi>Luke.</hi> 16. In the parable of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Diues. Diues</hi> is condemned for want of mercie, that hee had enough to beſtow on pride and vanitie and pompe to ſet out himſelfe, but nothing to giue to his poore and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe brother, ſheweing the doome of all ſuch wretched perſons; ſuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, which haue this worlds goods, and yet let their Godly brethren want, ſhutting vp the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing good; the charge of crueltie and want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, lyes heauie vpon ſuch, for he that turnes his eare from the crie of the poore ſhall crie himſelfe and not be heard. An other thing of omiſſion is when he neglects to pay the due wages and recompence for the worke of any poore man. For if it be a miſerable ſinne not to doe good freely where neede requires, it is much more abominable and damnable not to giue a due debt and reward of the worke.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Deut. 24. 14. Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſeruant, thou ſhalt giue him his wages for his day, nor ſhall the ſunne goe downe vpon it.</hi> This is condemned as an vniuſt and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, that when one hath hired a ſeruant or any to doe his worke, when the worke is done, he ſhould either giue him no
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29174:136"/> wages, or elſe giue it him in conuenient and due time, but hee muſt ſeeke for it, when he ſhould haue vſe of it, for his releife, and God ſaith there if ſuch a one be pinched with neceſſitie and crie vnto God, God will heare and reueng his wrong. And <hi>Iob</hi> to proue himſelfe no hypocrite, vſeth an imprecation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſinne in <hi>chapter.</hi> 31. that if he haue eaten the fruite of his land without ſiluer, and hath not paid the wages to him that telled it and brought in his harueſt, or if the furrowes of his land haue cried together againſt him, then let his grounde bee accurſed, as indeede he had beene an accurſed perſon and broken this commandement in an high degree. And if he had done ſo, the verie earth would haue cried, the furrowes would haue made a complaint againſt. For two ſinnes there be in the ſecond table that makes the land crie to God, that he can haue as it were no reſt till he take vengeance, the one Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and the other oppreſſion and crueltie againſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. As afore in <hi>Deutrimonie</hi> and in <hi>Iames</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Howle you rich men,</hi> and why? what miſerie is neere? why the crie of the poore oppreſſed by you, is come vp in the eares of the Lord; When one gets his good ſo ill, and enricheth himſelfe by withhoulding other mens dues, though the man ſhould be ſilent and ſay nothing; yet his neceſſitie, his bellie and his backe, would make an hideous outcrie before God til he had executed his vengeance. And for ſinning in this branch of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <hi>Iehoiachin</hi> was blamed <hi>Ierem.</hi> 22. 13. to 20. verſ. Which is ſo much the rather to be noted, becauſe moſt men thinke that the differences of perſons may make ſome excuſe for their ſinne, but it is not ſo. For if any might vſe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure of an other without recompence, then might the Kinge who is the ſoueraigne Lord of all; yet he being a King is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by God for this, it is ſaid he built his houſe without equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: how is that proued? he vſeth his neighbour without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and giues him not for his worke and for this cauſe and his filthy couetouſneſſe, God would not vouchſafe him the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honour of men, to be couered with earth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was dead, but he ſhould be buried as an aſſe, his skinne puld ouer his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:137"/> eares, ſtript of all hee had, and then dragd without the Citie, throwne out that his carcas might be food for beaſts &amp; birds and what was his crime? why this, he did not reward the poore but ſerued himſelfe vpon them. And this commandement is broken in omiſſion of thinges pertaining to the bodie as in not doing workes of mercie, and in not paying wages and dues to thoſe to whom they are due.</p>
               <p>The omiſſion of the dutie to the ſoule is either of ſuperiours or inferiours. Of ſuperiours as firſt and cheifly of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, if he doe not preach and admoniſh his people plainly and fathfully, he is guiltie of murdering &amp; diſtroying their ſoules. As in <hi>Ezek. 32. If hee tell not the people of their ſinnes they ſhall die in them, but the bloud ſhall be required at his hands,</hi> and if hee doe tell them though they amend not he is free as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am innocent of the bloude of you,</hi> and why? <hi>becauſe I haue tolde you all the counſell of God and kept nothing backe.</hi> And for other gouernours alſo as the parents and maſters of families, for euerie man is a biſhop in his owne familie. For ſo he ſaith in <hi>Deut. Thou O Iſraell ſhalt teach theſe thinges vnto thy children thou ſhalt talke of them &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe then that haue no care to teach their children and ſeruants to know God, or to come to the word of God, wherby they may be ſanctified and brought to ſaluation, ſuch embrue their hands with the bloud of their ſoules, and are guiltie of crueltie, becauſe through their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they let thoſe that are committed to their charge to run headlong into their owne diſtruction. Such are thoſe againſt whoſe ſoule this charge ſhall lye harde at the day of the Lord; That neuer ſo much as will their inferiours to come to heare Gods worde and to ſuch exerciſes, as may encreaſe their knowledge, but rather permitte, yea encourage them to breake the Lords ſabboth and ſpend it in fooliſh and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked exerciſes either at ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e or elſe abroad to gad to other towns to commit ſinne.</p>
               <p>Inferiours alſo when they will not take inſtruction, omit that dutie that ſhould ſaue their ſoules. As in the bodie that ſeruant that will not eate food when it is allowed him is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29174:137"/> of his bodie; ſo he that when he is taught and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and caſts it of, his blood ſhall be required at his owne hand, and God will proceede againſt him as againſt a wicked perſon and cruell, that hath done no good to his owne ſoule.

Now that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed and ſinfull anger which eyther hindreth one from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to the perſon with whom he is angrie, by praying for him, or kinde admoniſhing him, or elſe when it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without ſufficient cauſe, or exceeding eyther in the time or the meaſure. As <hi>Paule, Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath, nor giue place to the diuell.</hi> That which was for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and preſent paſſion is naturall, but if it lie ſoking and lingring, and ſinke in deeper into the heart, it growes then to be diueliſh; and ſo if ones anger be aboue that, that the qualitie of the fault requires, this is raſh and comes not through the folly of the partie with whom he is angrie, but through his folly that is angrie. Therefore we muſt looke that we be neuer angrie without a iuſt cauſe. And then that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion our anger to the ſinne committed againſt God, not to the iniurie done to vs; for that proceeds from pride, and is no better then reuenge, and therefore muſt more be grieued at
<pb facs="tcp:29174:138"/> things breaking the firſt then the ſecond table, and alwaies that that doth moſt diſpleaſe God, and is moſt odious to him muſt doe the like to vs. And yet let not the ſunne goe downe vpon it neither, but let it quicken vs to prayer for the perſon, and with a zeale of Gods glorie. Now the meanes to keepe vs from this fooliſh paſſion of raſh anger are theſe; firſt, often to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon our owne ſinne and vileneſſe. As <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 2. he ſaith, <hi>Shew all meekeneſſe to all men.</hi> I but might ſome ſay, I am of a verie cholericke and hot nature, that I cannot but be angrie with them. But you your ſelfe were in times paſt diſobedient. As if he had ſaid, thinke of this a little, and conſider how bad your ſelfe both haue beene, and are ſtill, and that wil coole your choler and make you more meeke to others that offend, ſo that he that ofteneſt remembers his own ſinne will be moſt patient to an other, and none are more eager and paſſionate againſt the ſlips of others, then thoſe that are moſt ſlacke and negligent to examine their owne great ſinnes. So that could we conſider our owne ſinnes how rebellious we haue beene againſt God, &amp; how often iniurious to men, this would make vs more quiet and to take more deliberation, before we were ſo much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it would aſſwage the laying and take away the edge of our raſh anger againſt the weakneſſes of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, labour to get wiſedome, alwaies and in euerie thing to behold gods prouidence, and to ſee his hand ruling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing, and to perſwade our ſelues that all things come to paſſe by his purpoſe and direction, and then we ſhall not ſo ſoone fret againſt men as <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>Shemei</hi> rayled vpon him and he looked to God and did not fixe his eyes downewarde onely to <hi>Shemei;</hi> it was ſo farre from diſtempering him, and ouerheating him that it quickned him to prayer, and made him ſo much the more humble and earneſt before God. For he ſaw then (and ſo may wee) that though it be vniuſt in man, yet it is iuſt with God, and though we haue not deſerued it of men and they wrong vs, yet we haue deſerued it at Gods hands, and more to he doeth vs no wrong at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, auoid the occaſions that will prouoke vs to it; as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29174:138"/> men will keepe gunpowder and tow, or ſuch drie ſtuffe from the fire: ſo let vs be as wiſe to preſerue our ſoules from thoſe ſparkes that would fire it with anger, as; for the companie of froward perſons, whoſe words and vngracious dealing will much moue one to paſſion and anger from gamning and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe that make men light and readie to take vpon light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as the drunkard ſaith, they haue ſtricken me, but I will to it againe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is good to marke and obſerue thoſe that be ſtird vp with paſſionate anger, ſee their countenance, how vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and misfigured it is, and how rude their actions, how abſurd their words, how baſe and contemptible all their behaniour is, and the light of this in an other will be ſome meanes to make one loath it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, conſider what teſtimonie the word of God giues of this fierceneneſſe and angrie raging mood, and of froward and vnquiet perſons. <hi>Anger reſts in the boſome of fooles.</hi> Euerie time that one giues place to this vnruly paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he makes an open proclamation to all that be by of his owne folly, ſo much furie, ſo much folly, the more chafing, the leſſe wiſedome, hee that cannot rule himſelfe, but muſt breake out to his owne ſhame vpon euerie ſmall and light occaſion; teſtifies to all that ſtand by, that he hath no true knowledge of God, no knowledge of himſelfe, no ſound diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſetled order in his heart. Let men excuſe it how they will, it is their nature &amp; you muſt giue them leaue, then you muſt giue vs leaue to giue credit to Gods word; if it be your nature, it is a fooliſh nature, and a proud nature, and if you ouercome not this nature, you ſhall neuer be but a foole in Gods account. Oh but you muſt beare with vs, and not thinke ſo hardly of vs for our infirmities, well, ſometimes men may put vp their raging without words; and beare their ſtormes with ſilence, but it cannot be but ſuch a man ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the brand of a foole, and in his heart he that ſees him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but beare this opinion that he is a man without wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>He cannot reuerence him in his heart, he cannot but yeelde
<pb facs="tcp:29174:139"/> that the ſaying of the holy Ghoſt is true, that <hi>a focle in a day is knowne by his wrath,</hi> You can hardly find a fooles heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome coales of fretting and anger. And theſe be the means to kepe one from this firſt inward breach of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iz.</hi> carnall, fleſhly and ſenſuall anger, that comes from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, hardens our brothers heart more, and hinders our ſelues from doing the good that elſe we might.</p>
               <p>The ſecond breach of this ſort is enuie, a bitter affection for the preheminence of an other aboue our ſelfe, an hatred of our brother for ſomething that he hath, which we would haue but cannot. Thus the diuell was a murtherer from the beginning, in that he carried ſuch an enuie to our firſt parents, by reaſon of their good eſtate, as he neuer reſted till he brought them to as bad caſe almoſt as himſelfe. Thus alſo <hi>Caine</hi> brued enuie ſo long in his heart, till he practiſed the ſlaughter of his brother, with his hands. For he carried ſuch a malice to him in his heart, that he could not afford him a good word or countenance; but what was the matter? why his brother was liked of God, and better accepted then he, but what fault had he done? This was all, God loued him better, and well he was worthie, for he was more holy and vpright, but indeede a proud heart thinkes all is loſt that comes not to him ſelfe. So <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, they carried a dogged affection againſt him, and gaue him all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh lookes, words, and entreatie. And how had <hi>Ioſeph</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them? what wrong had he done? what euill had he ſpoke or practiſed? ſurely none. But he behaued himſelfe ſo well and honeſtly, that his father did eſteeme of him, and loue him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any of them. And therefore they take it in high ſcorne, that any ſhould be preferd before them in their fathers fauour. But he had deſerued it; that is all one, they cannot endure that their father ſhould loue any better then them, and therefore they will make him away, he ſhall not liue.</p>
               <p>Now how wicked a ſinne this is, it appeares if we conſider of the cauſes of the ſame, and the effect. The cauſes are pride, and aboundance of ſelfeloue, but exceeding want of true loue; for loue enuies not, but ſelfeloue and pride would haue all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29174:139"/> themſelues, and they thinke that they are wronged if another haue any thing more then themſelues. Then the effect that it brings after it is murther, if it be poſſible as in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and the Phariſes who when they began to beare a grudge againſt Chriſt, becauſe he had better gifts and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count among the people then themſelues, and then were not well till they had nayled him to the croſſe. This man alſo is a twofold murtherer, and kils after a double ſort. For firſt he hates his brother whom he ought to loue ſo much the more; for as God doth giue more graces to euerie one, and ſo ſhewes his loue more vnto him, ſo is it our duetie both to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gods dealings, as alſo to ſhew our loue and kindneſſe the more, becauſe God ſhewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his, but now hates him for this cauſe, and he he that hates his brother in his heart, is a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he he is a murtherer of himſelfe to, for enuie is the rotting of the bones, he eates vp his owne heart, and impaires his owne ſtrength. And therefore as the glutton and drunkard is a murtherer, becauſe he weakens himſelfe, and hurts his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by exceſſe, ſo be theſe alſo that by this curſed affection drie vp their owne blood, and conſume their owne bodie. So <hi>Caine</hi> ſet his crueltie on worke, firſt in his owne bodie, and was vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall againſt himſelf, and after againſt his brother; firſt by grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and repining he made himſelfe ſicke, disfigured his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and made him looke pale and wanne, his face was caſt downe, his marrow began to conſume and rot, and then he fell to take his brothers bloode for a medicine to eaſe his payne.</p>
               <p>An enuious perſon then is guiltie of murther two waies. Firſt, for hating his brother, whom he ought to loue as himſelfe. Secondly, by entertayning ſuch a fretting and canker that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes his owne bodie, which he ought to preſerue. Now the way to keepe out this monſter, is to get ſtore of charitie in our hearts, and then we are fenced and armed againſt repining at an others good. When ſhall you haue a louing mother that will grudge at her childs beautie, or wealth, or good name?
<pb facs="tcp:29174:140"/> when will ſhe think her child doth to well and be ſorie becauſe he is in to good an eſtate? nay neuer, and why? becauſe ſhe loues it, and that is a buckler againſt all enuie.</p>
               <p>Soe much for the inwarde breaches of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The outward follow. And firſt by geſture, by any vnhappie &amp; froward action or behauiour done to deſpite, grieue or anger our brother. As Chriſt condemnes the ſaying of <hi>Racha,</hi> which is not a word ſignifying any ill name or reprochfull tearme, but a cutted anſwere ioyned with a contemptuous and ſcornefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour to diſgrace our brother. As if one ſhould ſay what you ſir, come vp geape, or ſuch like when the vntoward and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull geſture to grieue our brother makes it a finne. And ſo the wicked perſons firſt practiſed murther againſt <hi>Steuen</hi> in their geſture, for they gnaſhed their teeth at him. And ſo <hi>Luke.</hi> 16. Chriſt had ſpoken againſt couetouſneſſe, and then the Phariſes, and ſo many as were couetous ſnuffed at him, they will haue him know they ſcorne to be controlde of him, and therefore they make but a puffe of him and his ſermon. And ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> was driuen away from <hi>Laban</hi> by his euill &amp; hard coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and cariage of himſelfe, for he could not looke vpon him in peace as at other times, but his countenance was ſowre and lowring as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaies to his wiues. And therefore he could tarrie with him no longer. And this is ſo much the worſe if it be in an inferiour towards a ſuperiour, as if the child or the wife ſhall ſharpen their face, and looke frouningly and maliciouſly vpon their parents or husbands; this is a great offence, and how euer they may count it a ſmall matter, yet thoſe againſt whom it is done, feel what griefe it brings, and that they could with more eaſe ſuffer a blow of an other then ſuch a dogged looke there. Firſt then heere we are forbidden to be bolde to grieue others by carying our ſelues in countenance or behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rudely and vngraciouſly towards them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in word by prouoking tearmes as Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>with hell fire.</hi> And <hi>Paule 1. Cor.</hi> 6. Rankes them in the number
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29174:140"/> of adulterers, buggerers, and ſuch like filthie perſons, and ſaith that <hi>no rayler ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>One ſhall giue an account for euerie idle word.</hi> Then if God be ſo iuſt a Iudge that he will not beare with idle and fruitleſſe ſpeches, that are ſcattred in the earth to no purpoſe, how do they thinke to ſpeed that haue not only aboundance of waſt words, but their mouthes alſo are full of curſing and bitterneſſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euerie ſmall occaſion; if they be croſt but in the ſmalleſt matters, and a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogged, their mouth runnes ouer with all vilde rayling and curſed ſpeaking ſuch as it is not meet to name them among Chriſtians. Thoſe therefore that finde themſelues guiltie of this that they be ſo eaſily prouoked, to ſuch foule and reprochfull tearmes, muſt confeſſe before God, that they bee miſerable breakers of this commaundement. For this though it be a drie blow, yet it is a ſowre blow and ſtrikes to the heart, and dries vp the bloud with ſorrow and vexation.</p>
               <p>But that we may be freed from this euill tongue ſet on fire on hell, we muſt pray God firſt, to ſet a watch before our tongues, that we may not ſpeake vnaduiſedly: And ſecondly, to giue vs a good heart. For according to the aboundance of the heart ſo the mouth ſpeaks, that is, the guider of the tongue, and as it were the warehouſe to the mouth; &amp; looke what ſtuffe good or bad is laid vp in the warehouſe, that you ſhall ſee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring abroad in the ſhop. The tongue no man can tame, but God can tame it. To him therefore we muſt runne that he will take away the euill of our hearts, and ſet ſuch a watch ouer vs, as that we may ſpeake good &amp; wholſome ſpeaches profitable to Gods glory, and the good of our brethren. So this commaundement is broken in word. Now it followes how it is broken indeede, and that firſt when one ſtrikes to the heart only without death. This hurting of our neighbour in reueng God hath appointed to be puniſhed of the Magiſtrate, by inflicting the ſame hurt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, that he in his heart of reuenge hath done to another. <hi>An eye for an eye, an hand for hand, foot for foot, &amp;c.</hi> And that moſt iuſtly to, that he ſhould drinke of his owne cuppe. He thinkes it a light matter in his paſſion to ſtrike out ones eye,
<pb facs="tcp:29174:141"/> therefore he ſhall feele himſelfe how ſmall a thing it is.</p>
               <p>He makes no bones to cut of a leg or an arme; well if he like it ſo well, he ſhall make triall in himſelfe how good it is, which ſhewes alſo that God doth exceedingly hate this venturouſnes and boldnes of men, to run vpon their brother in reuenge. And that we way the better ſee the foule vnlawfulneſſe of this ſin of reuenge, conſider what wrong it doth both vnto the partie, and to God, and to his owne ſelfe that would be reuenged. For the perſon on whom he ſeekes reuenge, he takes vpon to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him without any calling or authoritie, and therefore is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious. Why but, may not I doe to him as he did to me? No, God giues no ſuch allowance, therfore he goes beyond his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and for this cauſe is iniurious. Then to himſelfe he doth iniurie that ſeekes reuenge. For it imbitters his enemie more and makes him more madde againſt him. And then he is not ſure to ſpeed better, but he may get more hurt to himſelfe, or if he be to ſtrong for the other, yet he hates him more, and watcheth him a miſchiefe, &amp; beſides he ſtrips himſelfe of Gods protection, he neither can pray for a bleſſing, nor haue a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, becauſe he is out of Gods defence, he promiſeth no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor his Angels watch not ouer him, that is out of his waies; therfore he is ſubiect eyther to hurt an other, and ſo to imbitter him more, or to be hurt, and then he hath no comfort, for he ranne into his owne daunger, and ſought his owne hurt. Then he wrongs God moſt of all, for he takes Gods office out of his hand, for God hath ſaid, vengeance is mine, and I will reuenge. Who made you a Magiſtrate now to take Gods turne? What commiſſion haue you to lay hands on his image? But if I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this, he would alwaies be medling and ſaucie, I ſhould not haue any quiet by him. But God ſaith, I will reuenge. Thinke you God hath left gouerning the world, or is hee a ſleepe trow you, that he cannot ſee theſe troubleſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or doth hee want iuſtice or power that hee cannot or will not puniſh them ſufficiently, but you muſt needs ruſh vpon the breach, and paſſe ſentence your ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Nay, you doe God great wrong, he hath ſaid he will doe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29174:141"/> and will you preſume to ſtep before him and ſay I will doe it my ſelfe. But God is fitteſt to rewarde and reuenge iniuries for he is not partiall, and he tries the hearts and ſees all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, why he hated you, how long, and with what minde he did thus and thus to you, and he alſo can and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the puniſhment to the fault, whereas commonly if men might carue to themſelues here, they would cut a greate deale to deepe, or be to ſparing the one. But ſith God can doe it in beſt time and beſt meaſure and manner, and hath ſaid he will doe it, what ſhould you doe medling with reueng? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you will hurte your ſelfe, wrong an other and ſhoulder God out of his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for murther. That is either Secret or Open.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secret as by poyſon or ſome cunning deuice, ſuch as was <hi>Ahabs</hi> deuice, he would not openly murther <hi>Naboth,</hi> but he lets <hi>Ieſabell</hi> haue his ring and concents and conceales the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that curſed and bloudie fetch againſt <hi>Naboth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Ghoſt tearmes <hi>Ahab</hi> no better then a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. In like caſe <hi>Dauid</hi> woulde not ſlaye <hi>Vriah</hi> with his owne hands nor by any of his owne ſubiects, but he puts him a forlorne hope caſting him in ſuch perill that he could not eſcape, and that with a deſire of his death to, and then by this plotte to couer all, but God diſcouered both to himſelfe and to the whole world to, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was guiltie of murther.</p>
               <p>But the groſſeſt and moſt barbarous of all is when one with his owne hands openly doth take away the life of a man. This was condemned <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. and a reaſon added, Thou ſhalt not kill a man for he was made in the image of God.</p>
               <p>This is therefore to deface Gods image and as it were to raſe the princes picture and broad ſeale, yea this thing is ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God that if a beaſt ſlay a man, he muſt be ſlaine and his fleſh muſt not be eaten. Now if God will haue the beaſt ſtoned which hath ſlaine a man though he haue neither lawe nor reaſon to reſtraine him, much more thoſe worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beaſts, that hauing Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement and reafo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold them backe, yet by al theſe bars cannot be kept in from violating the image
<pb facs="tcp:29174:142"/> of God and the ſoule of man. Beſides they haue ſeene how ill murderers haue ſped; as <hi>Caine</hi> what a curſe, what a brande did God ſet vpon him that he was alwaies a runnagate and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and could find no reſt vpon the earth? And in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. It is ſaid that <hi>the lande is polluted and cannot be made pure but by the death of him that was the murderer.</hi> Now this is ſo much the more vilde by how much thoſe bee nearer bounde in any lincke or bond to him that doth this wronge. As a brother the brother, the child the father, the wife the husband or ſuch like, which makes the ſinne a great deale more haynous and odious. But moſt monſtrous and moſt indigne of all is it for one to lay violent hands vpon himſelfe, to whom he is bound by all bands. For though one be neere to father and mother &amp;c. yet his ſelfe his owne perſon is moſt deare to himſelfe and he ought to haue moſt care of himſelfe; therefore to rende his owne ſoule and bodie a ſunder is moſt horrible and breakes moſt bondes of God and nature. And this no beaſt will doe; Sometimes they will teare and goare one an other, but no beaſt was euer in ſuch extremitie of paine or in ſuch miſerie as that he woulde rage againſt himſelfe and ſeeke to depriue himſelfe of life. And this is noted of haynous perſons, as of <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> who were firſt violent and barbarous to others, and then at length they turned the point of cruelty vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>Therefore this ſhould make vs pray to God eſpecially from this higheſt degree of murther and moſt haynous &amp; execrable crueltie. For the cauſes that a man growes to this beaſtly rage and crueltie againſt his owne bodie, is firſt a monſtrous pride, that one will not be vnleſſe he may be as he luſt himſelfe; hee will not ſubmitte his will to Gods will. Secondly, vnbeleefe, that one hath no faith in God, nor neuer lookes for a good iſſue out of troubles, Thirdly, from extreame crueltie to others, as <hi>Saule</hi> when he had beene bloudily minded againſt the prieſts of God, and <hi>Dauid</hi> he made his conſcience ſo feirce as that it ſet vpon himſelfe, and wreeked his teene vpon his owne bowels. And <hi>Achitophel</hi> was cruelly bent againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:29174:142"/> and carried an earneſt thirſting after his bloud, and then at length he fell to be as ill minded to himſelfe, when he was once croſt of his purpoſe and deſire. Now let vs labour to keepe our ſelues from enuie and hatred, and take heede of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueng and God will keepe vs from murther; he that makes conſcience and prayes againſt the leaſt ſhall keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſafe againſt falling into the greateſt. Thus much for the thinges forbidden in this commandement.</p>
               <p>The thing commanded is generally to loue our neighbours ſoule and bodie as our owne. And the particular duties that in it are giuen in charge are either inward or outward. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are two, Meekeneſſe, and Compaſſion. Meekeneſſe that is a milde and quiet and louing diſpoſition of the heart, and a kinde and curteous affection to our neighbours. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Epheſ. 4. 32, Be ye curteous one to an other and tender hearted.</hi> This curteſie he oppoſeth to anger and bitterneſſe of heart, which he had named in the former verſe as breaches of this comandement: And reaſons why one ſhould carrie a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meeke affection towards his neighbour: one may be that which is ſaid in <hi>Iſ. Wilt thou be cruell to thy owne fleſh?</hi> we haue one God, one father, and be as it were one bodie, and muſt therefore be like affected one to an other as members of one bodie. And an other reaſon is 1. <hi>Pet. 3. A woman of a meeke ſpirit is much ſet by of God,</hi> and that which is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly applied to the woman is true. Of the man that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath a meeke and quiet ſpirit, he is in high account and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God and his Angels; as contrarie a froward and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious perſon, be he as conceited of himſelfe as he will, is baſe and contemptible in the eyes of God, and of all Gods children. And as Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Matt. 5. Bleſſed are the meeke for they ſhall inherite the Earth.</hi> Now the branches and parts of this meekeneſſe are, Firſt to forgiue one an other. As in the place of the <hi>Ephes.</hi> before <hi>be yee curteous forgiuing one an other as God for Chriſts ſake forgaue you.</hi> Meeting with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that might haue beene made, why I meeke? I am as ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affable and quiet as any man in the world can bee, ſo long
<pb facs="tcp:29174:143"/> as you doe not croſſe me, nor wrong me, nor diſgrace me but indeede if you will doe me any iniurie, or croſſe me of my will a little then you muſt pardon me, I am ſomething paſſionate I cannot endure it. Can you not endure it? What can you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure then? Surely no more then a Beare or a Lion or a beaſt can. But a chriſtian meekeneſſe will forgiue and forget iniuries and wronges, it will not only be kinde to the kinde and ſhewe curteſie for curteſie, for this the verieſt reprobate, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt diſſembler in the world may doe; but it will ouercome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with good, it will be kind to the vnkind, and put vp wrongs and offences. And as he lookes for pardon from God for farre greater matters, So he will not ſticke eaſily to giue pardon for theſe leſſer thinges. But he that cannot bring his heart to this to forgiue his enemie and to doe good to his enemie, he hath not yet attained to the firſt ſtep of the duties required in this commandement Thou ſhalt not kill; and therefore can much leſſe attaine to the latter and greater. A ſecond braunch and indeed an effect of this kindnes is to to conſtrue all things in the beſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take things in the beſt ſence and meaning we can, not to be ſuſpicious and miſdeeming. For this ill conſtruction and wrong interpretation of things by haling and wreſting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the worſe ſence wee can, is a meanes to fill our owne hearts full of bitterneſſe, and make vs readie vpon euerie occaſion to fall to brawling and contention with other men. When one ſhall be doubting, perhaps he thinkes thus of me, it may be he had this meaning, or did it in this intent; this will maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſlly infect the heart and fill it full of hatred and malice, and therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.

               <p>A thirde braunche and effect of meekeneſſe is to ſeeke after peace, to be a peace maker, to ſtudie to preſerue and maintaine vnitie and loue, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſal. Seeke peace and follow it,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:29174:143"/> as if he had ſaid, peace is a Iewell moſt precious, that if one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure for it he may find but elſe he cannot. I but will ſome one ſay, how can I get it? it flies from me I would faine be friends and he will not, I offer peace and kindneſſe, but he is froward, and I can finde no good entreatie at his hands: well, yet follow after though it runne from you for a while, purſue ſtill and at length you ſhall finde it and that to your great comfort., Now then a man followes after peace, when he avoids all things that might breede iarres and miniſter occaſion of offence; now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men there be, that would ſeeme to haue peace and haue men thinke well of them and deale kindly with them, but they care not how they behaue themſelues, and what they doe to offend and greiue euery one, and to ſtirre them vppe againſt them, but kindneſſe will doe euery thing that may winne peace and auoide all thinges that may hinder it, or breede ſtrife, yea he that is truly meete will rather in matters belonging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, part with his right in ſome part and be content to want ſome thing that is due vnto him, then he will raiſe vp contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſtrife. And he that doth not thus is not truly curteous, and therefore alſo not much ſet by of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inward dutie is compaſſion and pittie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer belongs and is to be performed to all men in time of their greateſt poſteritie, but this is proper to theſe that are in ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and miſerie; now this compaſſion and mercie is to haue a fellow feeling of the griefes and afflictions of other men, to weepe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that weepe, to mourne with them that mourne to beare the burdens of thoſe that be weake and ſo fullfill the law of Chriſt. This is commanded <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 13. Now therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloued putte on the bowels of mercie.</hi> He wiſheth them as they would be ſure of their election and haue a ſounde not of their holineſſe, and that God loued them, then let them put one the bowels of mercie, let the miſerie of other men enter into their hearts, and make their bowels yearne, euen as if their owne. Now this compaſſion and feeling muſt bee both to the ſoules and bodies. As for the ſoules we haue an example of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> that ſeeing the people as ſheepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:29174:144"/> a ſheapheard in an hard caſe for matter of their ſoules, he had compaſſion and mourned in his ſoule for them, and ſo hee wept ouer <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when he ſaw them ſo ſtubborne and ſo to reſiſt the grace of God and the good meanes of their peace. And <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that when he heard of the inceſtuous man he writt vnto them in many teares &amp; ſorrow, as if all moſt the ſinne had beene his owne. But contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this is the mercileſſe and pitileſſe heart and behauiour of ſuch, that are ſo farre from weeping and mourning for the ſinnes of other men and from hauing any pittie vppon them as that they deſpiſe them, and contemne and make a ieſting talke of it to their diſgrace, rather then pray for them, or greiue for them to their helpe and amendment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and worſe, many be ſo diueliſhly minded and ſo reſembling the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell their father, as that nothing reioyceth them more then to heare of an other mans fall, eſpecially if he haue beene a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour and ſtood for religion, then if he fall it is ſuch good newes and makes them as glade as if they had gotten a great bootie. But little doe they know how they ſinne againſt their owne ſoule, and prouoke God to let them fall into the ſame ſinnes, and to giue them vp vnto worſe offences, that after they may finde the ſame entreatie and others ſhould reioyce and mocke at their fall as they haue done at the fall of an other, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a pitileſſe heart and dealing towards an other mans ſlip, is the next way both to make themſelues fall into the like ſin, &amp; ſhut vp the hearts of men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewing any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion vnto them.</p>
               <p>Alſo for matttes of the bodie, we muſt be touched with the greefes of other.. as. <hi>Heb. 13. 3. Remember thoſe that are afflicted as if ye were alſo afflicted.</hi> And we muſt be as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, now we know that the members be all pertakers of the greefe &amp; paine, if any one yea but the meaneſt ſuffer any thing; and ſo if we haue that loue that ought to be in the hearts of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we cannot chuſe but we ſhall feele in ſome part the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of chriſtians and ſee that they ſhall in ſome parte alſo pertaine vnto vs. And this the example of <hi>Iobs</hi> frends <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 11. ſhewes; it is ſaid that hauing heard of the miſerie whereinto <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:29174:144"/> was ſuddenly caſt they came to him. What to doe? not as common cuſtome is to bid him be of good cheere, and we hope he ſhall doe well, and ſuch ſhittle comforts, for noe man can giue ſounde wordes of conſolation, vntill himſelfe haue a true ſpitit of conſolation, but they came to lament with him; they wept with him, rent their cloths and ſat down with him mourning. They hearing their freends woe, would let him know that they were touched with it, and therefore they ſhew it by crying and ſitting on the duſt making his caſe theirs, ſo neere as might be. And if one be thus ſenſibly affected with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſorrowes this good effect will follow, that they will be very readie and willing to releeue them and ſhew workes of mercie vnto them. As if one part be troubled with a kinge paine, you neede not make a long oration to ſtirre vp the other parts to vſe the beſt meanes they can to eaſe and helpe it, for they are pertakers of the greefe. But for want of theſe bowels of mercy, it comes to paſſe that men be ſo hardly drawne and hailed to any worke of mercie, that it muſt be puld from them by maine ſtrenght, and ſo many arguments, ſo many reaſons, ſo many inducements muſt conſtraine them to it before they will yeelde, and then when all this is done, they droppe out with a thing of nothing, nothing to the purpoſe, and thoſe that be bountifull and liberall enough in matters of vanitie and luſt, be ſo holdfaſt, and ſparing for workes of mercie, that one can hardly wring a pennie from them, by all the perſwaſions hee can make: and what is the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they be ſo ſlow and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? becauſe they haue not nor will not haue any ſence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens miſerie, but putte away all conſideration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of theſe thinges, and giue themſelues holy to pleaſure. And therefore in theſe matters they will coſt them many teares, and bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noe good hereafter but much ſorrow; they care not how farre they runne, and what charges and expences they bee at, but for worke of mercie and dutie of compaſſion that will further their reckoning, and comfort their ſoules, and doe good to the Church and Saints of God, it comes ſo ſlowlie &amp; ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily, as though it were all loſt, that is that way beſtowed. And
<pb facs="tcp:29174:145"/> the cauſe is, becauſe they haue a heart mercileſſe and voide of compaſſion. Now the outward duties follow. And theſe are three in number eſpecially to be regarded.</p>
               <p>The firſt is an amiable and louing behauiour of ones ſelfe towards others, for as a ſowre looke, &amp; an auſter conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous geſture breakes this commandement, in that it alienates mens hearts from vs, and is a preparatiue to hatred; ſo it is a fruite of loue and a part of keeping this commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that one ſhould by all good and gentle cariage of himſelfe ſhew his loue and willingneſſe to doe good ſo neere as he can to all. And this is a thing noted in <hi>Abraham</hi> as a matter of commendations and a teſtimonie of his humble and louing heart, that where he came he was verie curteous to all men, euen infidels, men of a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and did carrie himſelfe, in all good ſort vnto them who euer. As when he had to doe with the <hi>Hittits.</hi> Firſt, he bowes himſelfe in all curteous ſort, and then his words were gentle and nothing ſauouring of a proud commanding, but with all milde and kind perſwaſions and intreatie, and then when they wilde him to burie the deade in any of their ſepulchres, giues them heartie thankes and with the like curteſie and good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as a fore, propounds his requeſt. And this gentle dealing did ſo winne the hearts of theſe heathen people, and made him ſo well account and eſteemed amongſt them, as they ſay to him thou art a prince of God amongs vs, and would denie him nothing. And ſo when he met the Angels, which he tooke for no other but for comon trauailers, he ſaluted them, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bodie in all dutifull ſort and gaue them good tearmes and called them Lords and intreated them to eate a morſell with him. And by this affability and kinde vſage of himſelfe he did not only get fauour and good account amonge thoſe with whome he liued; but hath gotten credit till this day and ſhall to the worlds ende, that being a man of ſuch worth and good deſert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo well graced, and of ſuch place and wealth, all this did not make him ſowre, careleſſe or diſdainfull, but hee ſhewed him kinde and amiable euen to the meaneſt. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede proud lookes hawtie lookes and a ſcornefull and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29174:145"/> eye that is ſuch a thing as God abhorres, he doth abhorre an hautie eye and arrogant lookes. As he ſaith in the <hi>Prouerbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we ſee this is ſuch a thing as many doe it for their credit, and thinke to get credit by this looking on high. Thoſe among vs that be men of no worth, that haue no good qualitie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie nothing commendable or worth eſteeme inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, no grace to praiſe them, no wealth to ſet them out, no parentage to make them had in account, ſwaggerers, ruffins, prophane beaſts, &amp; filthie drunken ſwine, that make their belly their God. Theſe abiect baſe perſons, the ſcumme and froth of the whole earth, rude in behauiour, wicked in heart, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in life, thinke if they can looke big, and carrie a proud and diſdainfull face, and ouercrow euery man, and care for no man, ſcorne their betters, and prefer themſelues before all; then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, they be men of ſome name, they ſhal be accounted of, &amp; they be worthy to be looked after, that thinke to get credit by contemning euery bodie, and to be had in account by making no account of any one; this is theis courage, this is their valure, and they haue nothing to grace themſelues, but this kinde of rudeneſſe. But in truth this diſgraceth, this diſcrediteth, this proclaimes their ſhame, and ſhewes that they be light, &amp; empty of all goodnes, and if they had many other good parts, yet this would hurie all, and make them contemned in euerie mans heart and eye, to be ſo ſcorneful &amp; contemptuous to euery one. This was <hi>Iſmaels</hi> kinde of life, his hand was againſt euerie man he regarded none, nor cared for none, but ſet them all at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and at naught, therefore euerie mans hand was againſt him, they made as light of him, and theſe alſo haue a iuſt <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> reward, euerie one is their foe, euerie man ſpeakes of their ſhame, and what haue they gotten now? For they that will be honoured muſt honour, &amp; he that will be kindly dealt withall, muſt deale kindly with others, and he that lookes for an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behauiour from others, muſt ſhew an amiable behauiour to others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond outward dutie is to defend the oppreſſed, and ſuccour thoſe that ſuffer wrong, and ill entreatie: a thing much
<pb facs="tcp:29174:146"/> commended in <hi>Iob,</hi> that hee pulde the pray out of the Lions mouth, and ſought out the cauſe of the poore, he was a father to the fatherleſſe, &amp; husband to the widow. And this did comfort him in time of his trouble more then all wealth in the world. This is commanded. <hi>Prouerbs. 24. 11. Deliuer them that are drawne to death, and wilt thou not deliuer them that are lead to be ſlaine? If thou ſay behold I know it not. He that pondereth the harts doth not he vnderſtand it? And he that keepes the ſoule knowes he not? will he not alſo recompence euerie man according to his workes?</hi> He ſhewes that if one ſee thoſe that be vnrighteouſly puld to death and oppreſſed, one muſt not ſtand by and ſay, alaſſe, what a world is this, who euer ſaw ſuch dealing? but one muſt put his hand to, and labour to his power, and as farre as he can to reſcue him, and deliuer him, for ſaith he, wilt not thou preſerue him? as if he had ſaid, art thou ſo mercileſſe that thou wilt not helpe the oppreſſed? But then he meets with our excuſes that men are readie to ſpeake in ſuch caſes, alas I knew not, that he had ſuch need of my helpe, and if I ſhould meddle, I might bring an olde houſe vpon mine own head, and trouble my ſelfe when I needed not. But he cuts of all ſaying, doth not God ſee thee and know thy heart, as if he had ſaid. Well theſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may dazell mens eyes and make a faire ſhew, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that can ſee nothing but ſhewes, but God he lookes not ſo much to the tongue, and what one can ſay for himſelfe, but he ponders the heart, doth not ſee it lightly but conſiders &amp; knowes euery particular thing and circumſtance; and therefore, it is no ſhifting and doubling when he comes to take a triall of vs: and he knowes, that all theſe excuſes come from ſelfeloue, and loue of lucre and commoditie, that one would ſpare coſt, and liue at caſe, and rather ſee an other oppreſſed with wrong, then ſtirre himſelfe a little to helpe him. And laſt of all he ſaith, you that be ſo loth to ſuffer a little trouble, and at a little charges to helpe an other man in his miſerie: know you not that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenceth men according to their works, that he cauſeth them to reape like for like, and may not you come to the like miſerie your ſelfe, and then becauſe you had no heart not will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29174:146"/> to helpe an other, you ſhall ſee others ſit as quietly by you, and not venture to giue you any helpe.</p>
               <p>But now men are come to that ſelfeloue, and want of other mens wrongs as it were a thing done in a farre countrey, and in an other age, as though it nothing pertained to them, they haue nothing to doe with it. But thoſe that be of the better ſort, will onely haue a little idle pittie, and mercie of the mouth in a few words; alaſſe I am ſorie, and it is pittie that honeſt men ſhould be thus wronged, but neuer put to an hand to helpe, nor ſtirre a finger to doe any good to their reliefe, neither be at paines nor charges to eaſe them, and deliuer the oppreſt, but moſt men beare this mind, that they would take more paines and be at more coſt to pull one of their owne beaſtes out of the ditch, then to pull a poore wronged Chriſtian out of the pawes of the perſecutor. But <hi>Ionathan</hi> was not of this minde, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his owne life to ſaue <hi>Dauids,</hi> and deliuered him out of the hands of <hi>Saule</hi> his father, though it ſeemed <hi>Dauid</hi> only ſtood betwixt him and the crowne. And <hi>Obadiah</hi> when he being the kings ſteward had as one would thinke need to looke that hee looſe not the kings fauour, and <hi>Ahab</hi> his maſter raiſed an hot and ſharpe perſecution, and would haue ſlaine all the Prophets, and he ſhould haue ſcaped but ill in liklihood, if his maſter had perceiued that he had beene a fauorite of them; and aboue that the famine was ſo great in the land that no bread &amp; water almoſt could be gotten for money, ſo that it was not only dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous but exceeding chargeable to keepe an hundreth men now, whom the king ſought with all diligence to put to death, yet notwithſtanding all theſe impediments, he ſtood faithfully for God and his Prophets, and kept an hundreth of them with bread and water ſufficiently, in the heat of perſecution, and the midſt of a great famine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rahab</hi> alſo ſo ſoone as ſhe had any ſparke of religion, and the feare of the true God, defended the ſpies, and that with the hazard of her owne life; for when the king would faine haue gotten them, and he had a purpoſe to make them ſure enough, ſhe hid them, and ſaued their life, and by that
<pb facs="tcp:29174:147"/> meanes alſo ſaued her ſelfe and all her houſehold, and had this priuiledge, that after Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> came of her ſtock and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie. But on the contrarie, moſt curſed and helliſh of all are theſe, that be ſo farre from helping and ſuccouring Gods afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſaints, as that they reioyce at their trouble, &amp; recount it one to another as a verie ioyfull tidings, that makes them merrie, and they put an hand to it, and to their power helpe it forward; theſe be cruell wretches inſpirde with the malice of the diuell, and vnleſſe they repent ſhall bee miſerable wretches hereafter freed with the vengeance of God as a reward of their crueltie.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt dutie heere commaunded, is to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the needie, that want, according to your abilitie, and their neceſſitie. This Chriſt commaunds, <hi>Luke. 12. 33. Sell that you haue and make you bags that waxe not olde.</hi> Where Chriſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be mercifull, meets with a common obiection. Indeed I would willingly beſtow ſomething vpon Chriſt, I owe him a good turne, and could finde in my heart to pay him, but alaſſe I haue nothing to giue, yet haue you nothing to ſell? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a ſtrike of corne, neuer a peece of land, no ſpare houſehold ſtuffe, that you can ſpare for Chriſt? If you haue ſold it, and giue it to Chriſt, &amp; for Chriſts ſake, euen as wicked a man will rather ſell ſomething to ſerue his luſt then that he will haue it vnſerued, ſo do you rather ſell ſomething for Chriſts ſake, then let him goe vnſerued. &amp; ſhew that you loue him as well, as they loue their luſt. O but if I ſhould ſell and giue thus, I ſhould be beggerd; nay Chriſt wils no man to beggar himſelfe, but make you bags; this is ſuch a treaſure, as no other is like it, you ſhould get a more excellent encreaſe, for no other treaſure, but it is of that nature that eyther of it ſelfe it wil corrupt, &amp; the canker &amp; ruſt will ſet on &amp; bring it to naught, or elſe the theefe may meet with it ſo that one is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall daunger, to looſe it, &amp; become poore. But this is ſuch a kinde of treaſure as in it ſelfe it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and it is ſo ſurely kept that no man can deptiue vs of it by force or craft, and then another benefit is, <hi>Where your treaſure is, there is your heart alſo.</hi> This is a good effect that if you lay vp a treaſure in heauen, your hearts will follow alſo. What is the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29174:147"/> reaſon that many men can come ſo hardly, and with ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to thinke or ſpeake of heauen, that we may as eaſily make a great milſtone aſcend vp into the skies, as to draw their thoughts to heauenward? it cannot be, becauſe their treaſure is not their, they haue ſent nothing before them thether. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men can talke nimbly and readily of grounds &amp; mony and beaſts, becauſe they haue laid vp their treaſure in theſe things, and let one goe whether he will from one end of the world to the other, his heart will ſtill be there where his treaſure lies, of this he will talke at his table, in the field as he walkes, as he lies, euerie where, and he is not weary. The treaſure drawes the hart vnto it. But theſe haue neuer laid vp one pennie in heauen, haue repoſed nothing in Chriſtes boſome, &amp; therefore haue no mind to thinke of him, and one may ſooner pull their heart out of their bodies then put any heauenly and conſtant meditation of God, and the life to come into them. But if one would let his chiefe wealth be with God, and lay vp his ſpeciall good in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, his chiefe thoughts and ſpeciall deſires and meditations would be of God and of heauen, he would talke of it as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, as nimbly, readily, as conſtantly, and with as little tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as the moſt couetous man of his money, and cattle, and nothing ſhould be ſo delightfull to him as to conferre and meditate of things pertayning to the life to come. And in the <hi>Prouer.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He that is merciful to the poore rewards his own ſoule,</hi> as if he had ſaid. Euerie man will yeeld that it is a good thing to be beneficiall to himſelfe and to doe good to his ſoule. But this is moſt certaine, that nothing in the world, no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no bargaine, ſhall bring ſo much profit vnto the ſoule as a mercifull heart and a liberall hand to beſtowe his goods upon poore chriſtians the members of Chriſt Ieſus; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor. 9. He that ſowes liberally ſhall alſo reape liberally.</hi> It is otherwiſe in this matter then it is in other harueſts; for let a man ſow neuer ſo good ſeede and vſe all diligence in preparing and fitting the ground, yet ſome caſualtie may befal which will ſpoile the harueſt, and a man ſhall not haue the ſeede againe; but heere it is certaine one ſhall haue a good harueſt, nothing
<pb facs="tcp:29174:148"/> ſhall marre his crop, if owne ſow but a cup of cold water for conſcience and in loue, it is ſowne vpon Chriſt Ieſus and he is the ground as in <hi>Matt. 25. I was hungrie and thiriſtie. &amp;c. and ye fed and gaue drinke to me.</hi> Therefore vnleſſe wee thinke that Chriſt will be a barren ground, it is moſt certaine that hee that ſcatters ſeed here ſhall find a large increaſe; that which is caſt abroad in mercie ſhall returne againe in goodneſſe, the more good any doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more good he ſhall receiue, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely becauſe God will reſtore it, and there is nothing that is more effectuall to continue the good eſtate and proſperitie of any familie then that the gouernour of the family opens his hand abundantly with all plentie of good workes of mercie. Now that one might doe this dutie of mercie rightly ſo as it may be pleaſing vnto God, and bring comfort vnto his owne ſoule, theſe rules muſt be obſerued.</p>
               <p>Firſt out of <hi>Micah. 6. deale iuſtly and loue mercie.</hi> Iuſtice in getting muſt be ioyned with mercie in beſtowing, that muſt be well go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

To doe as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith of the ill kings, that they would take away the peoples vinyards and oliues and feildes to giue them to his ſeruants and whom himſelfe pleaſed; now this is not mercie, nor to be counted liberalitie, neither doth it deſerue any better then theft. As many among vs care not howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly they get, whom they pinch, whome they oppreſſe and whom they wrong, but when the times come that they thinke to ſhewe their liberalitie, and to let all the world haue a taſt of bountie, no man ſhall be put backe but euerie man ſhall haue his fill for a time, and now they thinke they haue quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Well, and you muſt account them verie liberall &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull gentlemen, nay firſt let them be iuſt and then they may be mercifull, but till then all is oppreſſion and robberie and ſpoyling. And may idle miniſters that get many benefices into their hand, and make themſelues fat with the peoples bloud whom they ſterue and care not for feeding their ſoules at any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29174:148"/> time, but that they may get them a name of bountifull men, once or twice in the yeare they will come to the people, and feaſt them, and great good cheere they muſt haue; thus rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their ſoules to feed their bodies and vnder pretence of hoſpitality &amp; neighbourhood to make a pray of the people. But firſt, they ſhould doe as <hi>Zachaeus</hi> did firſt, reſtore the ill gotten goods, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt that is their own, they might be merciful &amp; do good, but it is no liberalitie to be lauiſh of another mans.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt be done liberally, without grudging and murmuring, as 2. <hi>Cor. 9. God loues a cheerefull giuer,</hi> it muſt not be wreſted out of one, but muſt come willingly and freely, or elſe the thanks is loſt. So <hi>Prouerbs. 3. 27. Withhold not the goods from the owner thereof. &amp;e.</hi> He makes the Chriſtian neighbour that is in neceſſitie an owner, one that hath good right and title to our goods according to our abilitie, for God hath giuen it to them, and it is their due, therefore he ſaith, withhold it not but giue it readily, put him not backe, but let him ſee that thou art glad to doe him good, and that it is a delight to thy ſoule to helpe him in his need. So Chriſt ſaith that the poore widdowes halfe farthing was more in Gods account the all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> large offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the richer men, for they did it moſt of them ambitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſome Phariſes meritoriouſly to binde God vnto them, and make him beholding vnto them; but ſhe did not looke to credit, for it was rather a diſcredit, that when all the reſt came with their great ſummes, ſhe comes me with a mite among the reſt, but ſhe was not aſhamed of that, neither did ſhe thinke to merit any thing of God, but deſiring to pleaſe God, ſhe gaue that ſhe had though it was but a little, verie freely, and therfore God accounted it a very free gift. Therefore we muſt looke that our gifts be freewill offerings, and come voluntarie, and then they are likely to be accepted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, one muſt looke to doe good, eſpecially to the houſehold of faith, though a man ſhould helpe all mankinde, yet his ſpeciall regarde ſhould bee to Chriſtians, that where Gods kindneſſe appeares moſt, their kindneſſe may bee moſt exerciſed, and they may doe moſt good where GOD
<pb facs="tcp:29174:149"/> hath giuen moſt good. For ſo <hi>Math.</hi> 25. that which they did to poore Chriſtians was accounted as done to him, and that he payd as a debt for his owne. Which confutes theſe, that if they doe any good, and beſtow any thing, yet be ſure Chriſtians ſhall haue nothing, but it is done hand ouer head without any regard to whom it is done, and euerie one ſhall fare better with them then he that is beſt; there is a certaine ſecret malice, and hidden inueterate enemie to good men, that they can beſtowe nothing but on ſuch that cannot pray for them, but will abuſe what euer they beſtow vpon them.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the things forbidden in this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo commaunded; that thou doe the one, and auoid the other certaine things muſt be auoided, which are occaſions of the breach of it, and hinder one from keeping it.</p>
               <p>And the firſt of theſe is Pride; for ſo much pride as there is in any, ſo much matter is there of the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, for ſo the holy ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>onely from pride contention comes,</hi> and he that is proud, is alwaies readie to ſtirre vp ſtrife, for he will doe wrong to any, but he will ſuffer wrong of none. So ſecondly, he ſo ſpends and ruinates his eſtate by ſeruing his proud luſt, that he hath nothing to beſtow in works of mercy, by ſetting vp himſelfe too high, he brings his eſtate ſo low, that he cannot afford to doe any good, he is alwaies in want &amp; need, ſtill ſhifting, and caſt behinde hand, becauſe he is too lauiſh in ſpending in needleſſe things to ſerue himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As the Sodomites though they liued in the moſt rich and plentifull countrey vnder the ſunne, and that which was fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all encreaſe, yet they could ſhew no worke of mercy, no good that they could doe, why? becauſe they were proud, and thought all too little that went to themſelues, and for their own delight, &amp; therefore can ſpare nothing to ſupply anothers need. So it is ſeene that many poore men, yet are able to doe more good, haue more to lay out vpon mercie, then many other that haue rich reuenues, and why? becauſe theſe with their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues haue an other thing, that is pride, which drinks them drie, ſo that they may truly ſay they haue nothing to giue, they are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29174:149"/> driuen to wants and neceſſities that they can neuer get before hand, they haue it not, and how ſhould they giue it? But why haue they it not? whoſe is the fault? It is therefore becauſe they haue fedde the waſting humor of pride, and that eates vp all which they ſhould beſtow on Gods poore Saints. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who euer would keepe this commandement let him ſtriue againſt pride for that will make him vnable to doe good, and make him drie to miniſter matter for euerie contention.</p>
               <p>Secondly, beware of couetouſneſſe, <hi>For a couetous man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be cruell;</hi> ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 1. This is the way of all thoſe that be greadie of gaine, <hi>they will take away the life from the owners thereof.</hi> He cares not what miſcheefe an other hath ſo he may haue lucre. Who euer ſtands in the way twixt him and his landes, hee wiſheth his death vnfainedly. If it be a father he could reioyce to ſee him laid in his graue, that he might haue his lands, if a brother, ſo he may gaine by his death you can bring him no more welcome newes then that his brother his dead. Alwaies coueteouſnes drawes after it a long tayle of craft and crueltie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, take heede of riotouſneſſe and drunkennes, for when drinke is in, the wit is out and grace is out to, then a man is ſuch light ſtuffe that the diuell may toſſe him about at his pleaſure. So in <hi>Prouerbs. 23. 29. To whome is woe? to whome is ſorrow and ſtripes without cauſe? &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, it hurts the bodie it ſelfe, &amp; Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it breedes ſtrife and contention, murmuring, brawling, and wounds without cauſe, for when they went good friendes (if drunkards can be good friends) to their pots, all on the ſudden vpon a madde humor no bodie knowes, they fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eares and are readie to ſtab and miſcheife one an other, and two or three houres after aske them why, and then they cannot tell, but twas a mad humor of theirs. Thirdly, they ſo ſpend themſelues this way and drinke vp all their wealth, as that they haue no abilitie to doe any worke of mercie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pride, couetouſneſſe, &amp; drunkenneſſe muſt be ſhund of all thoſe that will keepe this commandement; thou ſhalt not kill.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the ſixt commandement concerning the ſafety
<pb facs="tcp:29174:150"/> of our neighbours perſon, and what duties we doe owe vnto him. Now followes the ſeuenth commandement concerning his chaſtity and how we ſhould that way behaue our ſelues in theſe words.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt for filthie luſts and deſires of the heart conſented vnto. Though they be kept in &amp; neither breake forth in word nor deede, yet this verie luſt and deſire it ſelfe makes, one a breaker of this commandement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. As our Sauiour Chriſt the lawe maker and therefore alſo the beſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter of it doth teſtifie <hi>Math. 5. 27. I ſay vnto you hee that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29174:150"/> looketh vpon a woman to luſt after, hee hath committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrie with her all readie in his heart.</hi> They of olde (afore hee ſaith) meaning the Phariſes had ſaid thou ſhalt not commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, extending the commandement no further then the groſſe act and that they would not haue men commit, becauſe it would bringe reproch vpon their name and death vnto their bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Chriſt makes a more narrow meaning, and ſhewes that the adulterie of the heart is odious to God as well as that of the bodie, and that men cannot more eaſily ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that outward filthineſſe, then he doth the inwarde; for hee hath pure eyes that can abide none iniquitie, and hee ſearcheth the heart and reynes. An vncleane heart therefore wiſhing foule thinges, and meditating vpon vile matters is moſt hatefull to God.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this is to condemne thoſe, that when they heare Gods curſe againſt the breakers of this commandement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning adulterie, that thinke if they haue not broken forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the outward action, they are free and out of gunſhot, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not vnto them. But let them know that if they haue an ill heart, though men cannot charge them with the euill act, yet God can charge them with the euill thought, and that they are lyable to Gods curſe as well as thoſe that offend outwardly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede there be degrees, and the increaſe of ſinne bringes an increaſe of iudgement, and groſſer ſinnes ſhall haue more greeuous plagues, but the leaſt thought is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. And thoſe that will not humble themſelues, nor care not for inward motions will if occaſion be offered, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be drawne to the outward practiſe. For if luſt haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, bringes forth ſinne, and he that will not refraine it, in the conception, ſhall not be able to hinder it in the birth; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that would not haue ſin borne, muſt not let luſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue but labour earneſtly to kill it in the wombe as it were; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thought be free in reſpect of the ſight and law of men, yet it is not free from Gods, nor from his law, which was not only giuen only to reforme and rule the outward manners, but the ſoule alſo and the affections.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29174:151"/>
               <p>Secondly, this ſerueth for the inſtruction of thoſe which haue thus offended, that they muſt repent and craue pardon at Gods hands and intreat him of his mercie to kill this luſt and to waſh away the filthineſſe of their heart, that they may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be freed from the iudgement of God due to the ſinne, but alſo may hinder the birth of ſo filthy a monſter as will proceede of this ſo ill a conception; in either conception it is a foule fault after the conception to take any thing that may diſable the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and birth of it; but in this conception it is the greateſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſafeſt way to take ſuch a receite as ſhall quite kill it, that it may neuer come forth to light; and this conceite is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent and craue pardon, for elſe God will bring their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſinne to open ſhame and their inward filthie deſire to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward publique diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Now the meanes to purge ones heart and to make it cleane and pure from ſuch filthie affections, is firſt, to pray to God often and earneſtly, to puniſh the heart and to ſanctifie it by his holy ſpirit. Then ſecondly, to be faithfull and diligent in ſome honeſt and lawfull calling that may buſie the heart vpon ſome thing lawfull and profitable; for idleneſſe is the mother of foule luſts. As a ſtanding poole not hauing any courſe of running growes filthie of it ſelfe and full of toades and neuts and filthie vermine; ſo the heart that is not taken vp in ſome good and honeſt calling, is a fit place for the diuell to breede and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all monſtrous and filthie luſts, idleneſſe procures luſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; as what was the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why the <hi>Sodomits</hi> grew ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie &amp; vncleane, that no people euer were ſo filthy and beaſtly, but becauſe hauing the moſt fruitfull and abundant contrrie in the world (for it was like the garden of God) that yeelded them all commoditie and profit, grew rich, and then like foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men, as all naturall men vſe, grew idle and to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to nothing but there eaſe and delight, for their nature was no worſe then any of others; but their idleneſſe ſo corrupted their hearts, as the diuell had leaſure to caſt in, and they to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue all monſtrous and vncleane deſires whatſoeuer, and that was the cauſe that they were ſo outragious. Alſo temperance in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29174:151"/> meat and drinke, and watching and faſting. Theſe meanes by Gods bleſſing will ſlaye theſe luſtes, and emptie the heart of ſuch ill deſires, that one ſhall haue a pure and chaſt heart.</p>
               <p>But if that all theſe meanes being vſed, notwithſtanding theſe luſts will not be ouercome, but ſtill ariſe and ſtill ouerburden the heart and ſet it on fire with ill deſires, and the fleſh will not be humbled, then one muſt ſeeke the remedie of mariage and pray to God to giue him an yokefellow; and then one may looke that God ſhould heare his requeſts. For when hee hath done his endeuour to beat downe his fleſh, and yet cannot ſo tame it, but that he ſtands in neede of an helpe this waies, then God hath called him to the eſtate of matrimonie, and as hee hath giuen him a calling, ſo will he giue him ſuch an one as ſhal bee a comforter to him, and an helper both in this life and in the life to come. And ſo much for the inwarde breach.</p>
               <p>The outward breach of this commandement hath many branches. But the cheife are comprehended by the Apoſtle. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. Where he ſaith, <hi>the fruites of the fleſh are, adulterie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, vncleanneſſe, wantonneſſe.</hi> Theſe are the cheefe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward branches of this commandement. And firſt for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. That is, when the partie offending, is either maried or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, for if he be eitheir ioyned by mariage or contraction, that commits the act, then it is adulterie. This is a verie high breach of this commandement. For when they haue beene either married or contracted, then they breake the couenant of God. For when they come together in either of theſe knots, they doe make a couenant not only one with an other, but with God himſelfe, that hath appointed the ordinance, that wil faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; truly keepe their fidelitie one to the other, and therfore if they deale vnchaſtly, it is not only vniuſtly done one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they forfeit their bond to God, euen their ſaluation, and prouoke his curſe both on their ſoule and bodie. And this is a thing peculiar to adulterers, that hauing come in the ſight of God and before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Angels, to make a couenant, &amp; there
<pb facs="tcp:29174:152"/> alſo in the face and by the voyce of the congregation craued a bleſſing of God vpon their proceedings, they abuſe god, angels men and all, if after they breake this couenant and polute their bodies.</p>
               <p>But how foule and vile a ſinne this is, The ill effects that follow of it doe declare, the firſt is ſet downe <hi>Prouerbs. 5. 11. it conſumes the fleſh and the bodie.</hi> It is a fire in the bones, it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des eating &amp; incurable diſeaſes, that as the ſin makes one loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the ſight of God, ſo the plague may make him lothſom in the ſight of men. If one be ſo audatious as to breake the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of God, though it be a thing much neglected of men, and they will not cut him of according to Gods law, (for by the law of God the adulterer is as culpable of death as the will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murderer) yet God meetes with him, and by filthie diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes brings him to his death. <hi>Prouerbs.</hi> 6. 26. the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>it bringes one to a morſell of breade,</hi> that is, to extremitie of pouertie, and ſo <hi>Iob</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. ſaith of this ſin, <hi>that had beene a fire to haue rooted out all mine encreaſe,</hi> this will make ſpoile and hauocke of all a man hath. And it conſumes not only the goods and bodie, but there is a further conſumption then all this, <hi>hee that doth it deſtroyes his owne ſoule;</hi> hee forfeits his bodie and goods, and worſe then all this he gets a perpetuall blotte to his name that he ſhall neuer be able to put away, vnleſſe hee doe truely repent, and ſo get it waſhed away by the bloud of Chriſt that will make all cleane. But elſe hee ſhall haue a ſhamefull name, an ill report, all the braue apparell, all the bribing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring in the world will not couer this blotte of the name and eſtimation, for he is a needeleſſe theefe that doth not ſteale for neceſſitie, but of preſumption and therefore deſerues no pittie.</p>
               <p>We ſee that if a theefe vpon neceſſitie, (as it ſeemes to him,) but indeede no neceſſitie ſhould make a man ſinne) doe prige or ſteale from his neighbours, men haue ſome kind of mercie and doe not altogether ſo much abhorre it, but when one hath the remedie, and hath profeſſed his thankefulneſſe to God for the helpe, and his contentedneſſe and reioycing in it, he is a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29174:152"/> needeleſſe theefe he ſhall finde no mercie, but he deſtroyes his ſoule and makes his name to ſtinke among men. And he that doth committe adulterie doth not only deſtroy his own ſoule but he doth what he can to deſtroy an other mans ſoule to, and ſo to kill two at once, &amp; in this regard this ſin is worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either theft or murther. For if a theefe ſhould ſtrip a man of all hee had and beſides that take away his life to, the man were not one whit the worſe man for all this, but his ſoule might goe to heauen as well as if he had died in his bed, but hee or ſhee that inticeth an other to commit adulterie robs the party of his ſoule and ſaluation ſo farre as in them lies, for little doth he knowe whether euer they ſhall repent or be conuerted from this ſinne, for this is ſuch a wound as no phiſition can lay his hand to heale it, but the holy Ghoſt; no medicine can cure it, but the bloud of the ſonne of God; this is not to ſpoile his bodie but the ſoule, a far more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> robbing. For though one ſhould make the bloud runne about ones eares with many wounds, yet there were hope that one might find ſome skillfull chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make all whole againe, but he that hath ſtricken ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ſoule and conſcience, and hath kindled the fire of Gods vengance in the heart, how knowes he whether euer this ſhall be healed? And what a fearefull thing is it to be an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrument to draw an other into hell and to an incurable wound for any thing that he knowes?</p>
               <p>And againe an adulterer is a theefe for foiſting in his child in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other mans lands or goods, that, that which one hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for, and taken paines for, and hoped to leaue to his own ſeed and his poſteritie after him, he ſhould beſtow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his moſt mortall foe. For of all men in the world, he would be moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing if he knew of it to beſtow it on him, much rather would he giue it to a ſtranger whom he neuer knew before, then vnto one that had ſo ſhamefully abuſed him; and could better find in his heart to leaue his goods vnto a vagrant begger, then to one whom vnwittingly now he feedes and cloths, and who ſhall enioy all his laboure. This ſinne of adulterie therefore is a moſt foule ſinne in regarde of the wrong one doth to man, and to
<pb facs="tcp:29174:153"/> God alſo, who hath ſo great a regard of mariage, that it be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerued for the comfort each of other, as that he thought it not ſufficient that they ſhall binde themſelues in promiſe one to the other, but he will haue them alſo enter into a couenant with him, to bee true one to the other, which if they violate and contemne, it is a moſt odious thinge in Gods account.</p>
               <p>Now the vſe that we muſt make of this is; That ſith it is ſo foule a ſinne and yet our nature is ſubiect to fall into, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> after many corrections and humiliations, after many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and benefits when he was ſome thing well in yeares, and had the remedie alſo, yea and as the corruption of thoſe times was, many wiues, yet fell into his foule ſinne. This lothſomnes of the ſin and the proudneſſe of our nature to commit it, ſhould moue vs to vſe thoſe meanes and preſeruatiues which might keepe vs from it. For if <hi>Dauid</hi> did fall into it, to his great woe and to ſome blotting alſo and blemiſhing of his name, then we muſt not be ſecure and thinke our ſelues ſafe. But the meanes to make a man liue chaſtly in mariage, are theſe. Firſt, if there haue beene fornication before mariage that is a ſecret poyſon that lurkes within, and if it bee not ſtayd it will breake out to adulterie. Therefore that fire muſt be quenched by true repentance, and ſo it ſhall neuer flame out into adulterie; but elſe it will certainly haue his vent: an olde fornicator ſhall be an new adulterer, I meane by an old fornicator, ſuch an one as hath committed fornication before mariage without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for he hath a wilde fire within, that will not keepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in long, but will make him burne in luſt as faſt as before. And it may be ſaid of him as GOD ſaid to <hi>Caine,</hi> thy ſinne lyes at the doore; ſo his old ſinne lies at the dore readie to catch him, yea it will let him haue no peace, but lies in wait, doggs and purſues him, and meetes him at euerie turne till it haue brought him to naught, vnleſſe he by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance firſt bring it to naught.</p>
               <p>This then muſt be the firſt care if one haue beene a forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator to repent for that. But if one haue not yet, he muſt keepe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29174:153"/> and obſerue this ſecond rule. Euerie married perſon muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for pure and feruent loue to his yoake-fellow. As <hi>Prou.</hi> 5. He wils men not to follow after the ſtraunge woman, but how ſhall I chuſe? he anſweres in 18. verſe. <hi>Reioyce in thy wife of thy youth, and delight in her loue continually.</hi> If married perſons get feruent and pure loue one to another, this will keepe them ſafe, for it is not hauing of a wife, but the louing of her that makes a man liue chaſtly, and it is not the hauing, but the louing of an huſband that preſerues a woman from whoredome, but if ſhe haue him, and yet hate him, and diſpiſe him, ſhe is in danger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie day, to be defiled. Feruent loue then muſt be ſought for. Not ſuch as fleſh can yeeld; for the nature of fleſh is, as to be fond before, ſo to be readie after to finde occaſions and iarres, and diſlike, but it is a gift of God, and a ſparke that comes from heauen, and hath this vertue to make a man liue chaſtly. But now if one will ſay, Adulterie? Sure I will neuer be an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, yet for all that he cares not for his own wife, but contemnes and diſpiſeth her, he hath no warrant to ſay ſo: nay he takes the next way to bring himſelfe into the ſnares of adulterie, by this firſt breach of the bond of marriage, in that he doth not loue his wife.</p>
               <p>An other meanes to auoid adulterie is ſet downe in <hi>Prouerbs 2. 8. 16. If knowledge enter into thine heart, and wiſedome delight thy ſoule: Then ſhall it keepe thee from the ſtraunge woman that flattereth with her lips.</hi> To delight and reioyce in the pure word of God, and to embrace it in ones heart, this will ſo ſatisfie the minde, &amp; content the ſoule with ſweet comfort and delight, as that one ſhall not need to follow the impure and foule pleaſures of the fleſh that are contrarie to God and his word. But if wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome enter not into the heart, luſt will, and if a man finde no reioycing nor pleaſure in the word of God, he is in continuall daunger to ſeeke at the fleſh, for no man can liue without his delight, and though it breake not ſtreight to the mayne ſinne of adulterie, yet it will beginne with other vanities, and not ceaſe till it hath traced one through all the idle and fooliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and at length leaue him wallowing in this filthie and
<pb facs="tcp:29174:154"/> loathſome pleaſure, for certaine where there is not a pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light there is an impure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, will we be kept from this foule and monſtrous ſinne we muſt marke the rule of <hi>Salomon. Eccleſ. 7. 28. I find more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then death, the woman whoſe heart is as nets and ſnares, and her hands as bands. He that is good before God ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinne ſhall be taken by her.</hi> He ſhewes how one may eſcape the lewd woman, and keepe himſelfe free from her ſnares, namely, be a good man, walke religiouſly &amp; keepe peace with god, elſe he ſhal ſure be taught. He ſhews why God ſuffers filthy ſtrumpets, &amp; harlots to ly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, namely, that they may be as a gaile or priſon to keepe wicked ſinners, &amp; chains, wherin to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per all vngodly perſons, they be as fowlers to catch hypocrites that haue not the true feare of God, that thoſe which be hatefull to God for other ſins may be made hatefull to men alſo for this ſin. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men prouoke God by ſins that he hates as much, but be leſſe ſubiect to diſgrace in the world, then he giues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to thoſe ſinnes that may ſhame them, &amp; bring them into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt before the world. And it not as moſt men ſay alas he was an honeſt man till he ſlipt into this fault; no, had he been honeſt before, God would not haue deliuered him vp to this vilde ſinne. But becauſe he was wicked before, therefore God puniſheth ſinne with ſinne, and makes him more wicked out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that his inward wickedneſſe might appeare to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; he hath liued irreligiouſly in the firſt table, and now God in vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giues him ouer alſo to liue vnrighteouſly in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Theſe be the means to keep one pure, namely, an vpright life that one liue in no other ſinne that breaks off peace betwixt God and him. And to take delight in the word of God, and vſe all good means to get a pure &amp; feruent loue to the yoakfellow, and to purge out by godly ſorrow, that venime of ſornication, if any haue beene committed before, that elſe would infect the heart with adulterie; for mariage cannot kill luſt, onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance can doe that, and marriage is an helpe to a penitent man to preſerue his chaſtitie.</p>
               <p>But now if one haue fallen to adulterie, and broken the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29174:154"/> couenant of God, there is no way for him but onely one, euen to confeſſe his filthie ſinne, and to be grieued and iudge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for it, and then to lay hold on the merits of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> &amp; to craue Gods mercie, knowing that he can as eaſily forgiue to the penitent perſon, &amp; the blood of Chriſt can as eaſily waſh away adulterie in the higheſt degree, as the leaſt ſpot, of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe. So much for the firſt outward breach, <hi>viz.</hi> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, the next followes, and that is called Fornication, that is, when ſingle perſons commit the filthie act.</p>
               <p>And this howeuer it be not grieuous as the former, becauſe it doth not breake the couenant of God, and is not puniſhable with bodily death, yet it is a fearefull ſinne lyable to the curſe of God and damnation. For ſo 1. <hi>Cor. 6. No fornicator ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen:</hi> It is ſuch a ſinne as ſhuts one out of Gods kingdome, and caſts him downe headlong to hell, and the euerlaſting vengeance of God. And the ill effects of adulterie afore named, namely a diſeaſed bodie, a poore eſtate, a blemiſhed name, and damned ſoule, and the drawing and murdring of an others ſoule doe agree to this ſinne to. Oh but they will marrie the partie, and ſo all ſhall be well, and they will make an amends. But this cannot make an amends, for nothing can waſh away the pollution of the ſoule, but the bloud of Chriſt. But if you doe marrie the partie, why will you giue the firſt fruits of your bodie to the fleſh and the diuell, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to God? it is a ſhameful thing, to ſerue ſinne with the chiefe of his ſtrength, and God with the remainder. How can they looke for a bleſſed proceeding from ſo foule a beginning?</p>
               <p>Why will he doe ſuch wrong to his firſt borne to make him baſe borne; and his poſteritie a baſtardly generation? why will they beget a continuall ſorrow to themſelues, that they ſhould not be able to looke vpon their childe without bluſhing, and cannot ſee the fruit of their bodie, but they muſt looke on the fruit of their ſinne, and behold a witneſſe before them of their owne filthineſſe and diſobedience to God? Or if he purpoſe not to marrie her that doth this, why doth he rob her of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, and make her vnfit for any other elſe? Therefore this is
<pb facs="tcp:29174:155"/> a foule ſinne and daungerous, for vnleſſe it be repented for ſoundly, fornication before marriage makes a plaine and high way for adulterie after mariage.</p>
               <p>The third outward breach of this commaundement followes. And that is vncleanneſſe which is eyther vnnaturall or naturall; vnnaturall, as <hi>Sodomie</hi> practiſed of the Sodomites, condemned <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when man with man workes wickednes, woman with woman commits villany, or elſe that beaſtly ſin, when the ſeed of man is mixt with the ſeed of a beaſt. Theſe nature abhorres and they be commonly puniſhments of ſome other wickednes, and follow a verie prophane and dead heart, &amp; are worſe then dulterie. The naturall vncleanneſſe is eyther alone, one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may defile his owne bodie in moſt filthie ſorte, which though it be more ſecret from man, yet it is moſt abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, and often God brings it to light by puniſhing thoſe which haue vſed it with teares of conſcience, and horrible feares in their minde, or elſe with frenſie and frantickneſſe. Theſe puniſhments haue often fell on the practiſers of this ſecret ſin, and then all goes abroad, then they lay open, and vomit out all their owne ſhame, and howeuer they ſeemed chaſt and pure before, yet now their filthineſſe is brought to light. Alſo an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of naturall vncleanneſſe is betweene married people, eyther in their entrance into marriage, or elſe in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vſe of marriage. The vncleanneſſe in the entrance is eyther if one marrie an other of a contrarie religion; as a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and a Chriſtian to wed an Atheiſt or a Papiſt; their whole life ſo led till repentance and conuerſion, is vncleane in the eyes of God, for their marriage was not lawfull before God, and therefore in <hi>Ezra;</hi> theſe that had ſo married were conſtrained by God to put away both their wiues and children as illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Alſo if thoſe marrie together that be within the degrees of conſanguinitie or affinitie forbidden, they may cloake and ſhift as long as they will, but they ſhall neuer ſhift of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation of being vncleane perſons before God, ſith they marrie without the warrant, yea contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. Alſo thoſe that marrie without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29174:155"/> of parents, their mariage is lawfull, and life vncleane, till they be reconciled to God by repentance, and their parents by ſubmiſſion. Theſe be in the entrance and taking the eſtate of mariage. In the vſe of it vncleanneſſe is committed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in comming together at vnſeaſonable times; this was a cauſe that made the land of Canaan vomit out their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, becauſe they had no regard to obſerue times, and this was to be puniſhed with death in both parties in the olde law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time and manner of ſeparation was then inſtituted. Alſo in mariage one may deale vncleanly by exceſſe for want of moderation, for as a man may be drunken with his own drinke, and he were a drunkard that would ſit at home and ſwill till he were ouercome: ſo likewiſe a man may be vncleane in exerciſe, though otherwiſe his marriage be lawfull; and this ſinne though the hand of the Magiſtrate cannot puniſh it yet Gods hand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten findes it out, and the children diuers times prooue mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and vnſhapen, or elſe idiots and naturals, or elſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vngodly and ſtubborne, and thus Godmeets with theſe ſecrete ſinnes when men will not meete with him by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.</p>
               <p>The laſt breach of this commaundement is in wantonneſſe, which is the preparation and foundation for all the former, conſiſting eyther in things belonging to the bodie, or the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it ſelfe. In things belonging to the bodie as in the coſtly apparrell, not that there ſhould not be things fitting the eſtate, and that there were not a diuerſitie of degrees to be had, but in no eſtate or degree, may one be ſo exceſſiue as to hinder him from good works of mercie and religion, that one ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much time in trimming the bodie as he can haue no time for trimming his ſoule, and beſtow ſo much coſt in rich apparrell as hee can ſpare nothing to beſtowe on poore ſeruantes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in ſtraunge apparrell, as in <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the prieſt, the kings children are rebuked, for that hauing more money and maintenance then their neighbours; they did not beſtow it in doing any Worke of mercie to the poore, or prouiding any
<pb facs="tcp:29174:156"/> thing of profit for the commonwealth, but onely in ſetting out themſelues by new faſhions, that no new tricke or odde fooliſh deuiſe could come vp, but they muſt haue it ſtraight, yea they neuer thought themſelues well vntill they were beginners of ſome new fangled inuention concerning their coates, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther folkes might looke at them and luſt after them, and theſe kinde of perſons howſoeuer they ſeeme fine in their owne eyes, yet they be filthie in Gods eyes: Alſo in exceſſiue diet too much meat and drinke, for as one cannot lay on more fuell, but he ſhall haue a greater flame, ſo ſtuffing ones ſelfe with meate and drink will make the heart more outragious in all euill luſts. As the prophet ſaith, <hi>They riſe vp full, and then they neighed after their n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ghbours wiues, as a fed horſe after a mare;</hi> for though this be an homely compariſon, yet the holy Ghoſt vſeth it to make the ſinne more loathſome.</p>
               <p>Alſo in exceſſiue ſleepineſſe and lazing in bed, that a man liues ſo, as the world, nor the place where he liues ſhall be no whit the better for him, but he giues himſelfe onely to take his eaſe, to reſt his bodie vpon his bed: to doe nothing but eate and drinke and ſleepe, that that time which God hath giuen to get good and ſome knowledge of good and ſome knowledge of God, and aſſurance of ſaluation, a man ſhould abuſe to follow his carnall and vaine ſports, and to ſlugging on his bed; ſuch manner perſons be wantons, and by the Apoſtle put in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of filthie perſons that ſhall not inherit life.</p>
               <p>In the bodie it ſelfe, and that is eyther in the parts or the whole. In the parts as an eye full of luſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that ceaſeth not to ſinne, though thy bodie ſometimes ceaſeth for want of occaſion, or for weakneſſe, yet the eye is all buſied in vnchaſt &amp; wanton luſts. And the tongue in vnchaſt &amp; wanton ſongs and reading loue bookes, of daliance &amp; filthineſſe, which is a kind of contemplatiue fornication. They that made them be wantons and thoſe that read them, and ſo euerie other geſture that ſtirs vp ones ſelfe, or many an other purpoſely to luſt, that is wantonneſſe as the wiſe man ſaith, that a wicked man makes a ſigne with his finger, and ſpeakes with his eye.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:29174:156"/>
               <p>The whole bodie is abuſed to wantonneſſe in dauncing, for here euerie part is abuſed to daliance, the eye, the hand, the foot, and all in meeting in embracing, in tickling, and ſuch like. All the action is nothing but a profeſſion of an vnchaſt heart, here is an artificiall grace, an artificiall pace, an artificiall face, and in euerie part a wicked art is added to encreaſe the naturall filthineſſe; and if you call it a ſport, it is a verie diuelliſh ſport to vſe the bodie as an inſtrument of wantonnes and an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fornication and adulterie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe alſo haue offended in wantonneſſe that giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues libertie to be preſent, and ſee ſuch things that be practiſes of wantonneſſe, as ſtage playes, which ſerue for nothing but to nouriſh filthineſſe, and where they are moſt vſed, their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe is moſt practiſed: where the man is cloathed with womans apparrell, and that as ordinarily is put in vſe, which the Lord calleth abhomination; this is a way to breed confuſion of ſexes, and it is a plaine belying of the ſexe. Thoſe that then haue thus hurt themſelues or others muſt craue pardon, and repent, and thoſe parents, that themſelues in youth haue taken libertie this way, muſt reſtraine their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: contrarie to the common practiſe of filthie parents that haue themſelues beene olde fornicators and wantons, now that themſelues are ſpent, it doth them good, and makes their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eart glad to ſee their young children treade in their ſteppes, and runne madding and skipping vp and downe with all wanton and vnſeemely behauiour. This, howeuer men make but a ſport of it, yet God will not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, for if he cannot put vp the abuſe of one member alone, to wantonneſſe, he will neuer endure that the whole bodie ſhould be thus abuſed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, for the inward breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that is, luſting after another mans goods in the heart, the ſecret deſire of that which is none of ours, though one ſeeke not to get it wrongfully. For as in the former commaundement, the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie concupiſcence of the heart was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adulterie before God, though filthie practiſes did not breake forth: ſo heere he that inwardly lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth after his neighbours goods, is a theefe before Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29174:157"/> ſeat though he ſtay his hand from taking of them. So in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. He deſcribing wicked men ſaith, they haue <hi>hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in couetouſneſſe.</hi> Though they durſt giue ſuch libertie to their hands, yet it was the occupation of their hearts to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtealing, alwaies deſiring an other mans goods, euen as the thoughts and deſires of a chriſtian are buſied in thinking of the life to come, and of their latter end, and how to glorifie God while they liue, ſo there deſires and hearts were alwaies wandring and purſuing after an other mans goods, this was all the exerciſe of their heart. So <hi>Micha. 2. 2. They eouet feilds and take them by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt the heart fals a luſting, and what then? then there is no ſtay, the violence of their luſts carries them headlong, and they cannot be at quiet till they haue vndone a man, and ſpoild him of all his goods.</p>
               <p>And this was <hi>Acans</hi> firſt beginning of Theuerie. He ſaw a faire garment and a wedge of golde, that was no particular mans indeede, but he knew it was none of his, for God had challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the ſpoile of all that Cittie to himſelf, but he thought that there was enough for God and for him to, and therefore he let his heart looſe to deſire it, and then he could not hold his hands of, but tooke it to his owne deſtruction and the vtter ruine of his whole family, for they were all put to death, and the firſt beginning was his coueting heart. So <hi>Ahab</hi> lookes out of his window vpon a time, and ſees how commodiouſly <hi>Naboths</hi> vinyard ſtoode to his pallace, and thought the might make him a faire garden there, and he might haue a gooly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate walke as it were, ſo cloſe to his, &amp; therfore he would faine haue it. And ſo ſends for <hi>Naboth</hi> &amp; offers him ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, but <hi>Naboth</hi> knew that he might not alienate his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſſion from himſelfe, that God had giuen him, therefore hee ſayes him nay, but his deſire was ſo earneſt and importunate that it would take no nay, and therefore hee was euen ſicke with greefe and deſire of that which was none of his. And then there was no way left, but <hi>Naboth</hi> muſt be ſlane, and by hooke and crooke <hi>Ahab</hi> muſt haue the vinyarde, and ſo <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi>

               <p>The vſe that we muſt make of this is, that though we haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done any man wrong in one pennie, yet we muſt repent for the wrong of the heart and the ſecret deſire of the ſoule, or els before God we are culpable of the breach of this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lyable to the plague of God for it. Secondly, wee muſt learne to reſtraine our deſires and keepe in the wandring luſts of our heart, for that which it is a ſin to take before men, it is a ſinne to wiſh before God, therefore we muſt binde our minds to the good abearance, Now the way to expell this wicked and greedie couetouſnes of wealth is to conſider theſe two thinges. Firſt, the ſmall or noe good that riches can doe vnto them that haue them. Secondly, to conſider the certaine hurt that the deſire of them will bring. For the ground of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe is this, that men haue a falſe and fooliſh imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wealth will bring ſome happineſſe, and if they had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in good ſtore; then they ſhould be in good ſafetie and in an happie caſe, but that riches can make ones eſtate no whitte the better, it is proued in the <hi>Pſalme. 62. 10. 11. 12. If riches increaſe ſet not thine heart vpon them.</hi> He would haue one let his heart be neuer a whit ſet to his wealth, and deeme himſelfe no whit the better for the increaſe of them; what? is not one better; nor hath he not cauſe to be more glad when his purſe is full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie then if he had neuer a farthing? no ſure not one iot, and hee giues three reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſaith he <hi>God ſpake once or twice and I heard it, power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto God.</hi> This is reaſon, nothing hath any power to doe a man any good but God, therefore if he haue all the wealth in the world, his wealth cannot helpe him, it cannot keepe away any iudgement, it cannot free him from death nor from hell, but one may as ſoone goe to hell from weale or woe, <hi>Diues</hi> may paſſe into torment as well as the verieſt begger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. Nay it cannot beare of any one ſtroake of God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoule or vpon bodie in this life, it cannot keepe away ſickeneſſe not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29174:159"/> greefe; then if they be ſuch weake thinges, he that hath them is neuer a whit the nearer any good, nor further from any euill; why ſhould one either earneſtly deſire them, or greatly reioyce when he hath them? Secondly, <hi>To thee O Lord belongeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> There is no mercie but in God, nor kindeneſſe but from God, and that a man is kindely entreated, it is not from wealth but from God that puts loue into mens hearts for if ones ways be pleaſing vnto God, he will make his enemies to become his friends; and contrarie, if ones waies diſpleaſe him, he will make ones friends his foes, and thoſe that owe him moſt dutie and haue here tofore ſhewed moſt loue vnto him, to be his moſt bitter enemies and ſeeke his ouerthrow. As in <hi>Dauid</hi> when hee had ſinned againſt God, he rayſed vp his ſonne againſt him who not with ſtanding his welth and kingdome, ſought his life and would haue killed him. Thirdly, <hi>thou O Lord rewardeſt euery man according to his workes.</hi> That is an other reaſon, becauſe God lookes, to workes, not to wealth when he comes to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as if he had ſaid, moſt men dreame that it ſhall goe with them according to their goods and riches that they haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp; this were true indeede if their were no God, or elſe an idle God as Epicures imagine, that ſits a ſleepe in heauen, and cares not how things goes with men in the world, but if there be a God that gouernes the world that is awaken and hath the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of matters, then the queſtion ſhall not be with what a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath? But what he hath done; not what riches? But what grace and goodneſſe he poſſeſſeth; for ſinne ſhall haue ſhame, and he that is godly and mercifull and humble, hee ſhall haue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and he ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Sith it is ſo that riches are ſo little profitable or availeable, this muſt keepe out of our hearts this whoriſh deſire of riches that cannot profit. Secondly, as riches are ſure to doe vs noe good, ſo we are ſure that the deſire of them will doe vs much hurt, and as there is no helpe from the hauing, ſo there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine danger from the coueting. For in <hi>Timothie,</hi> the Apoſtle cals it, <hi>the root of all euill.</hi> Where this is there is ſinne enough, no euill that a man will abſtaine from, if it may procure his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb facs="tcp:29174:160"/> lucre, he will forbeare nothing if it lye in his way to gaine, neither will he doe any good that ſeemeth contrarie to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; therefore the daunger is greate that accompanies coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, namely the ruſhing into all kinde of miſcheefe and wickedneſſe and the neglecting and omitting of euerie thing that is good. For it hinders one from the cheefe meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and hinders the working of theſe meanes in him. How it keeps men from the word and ſacrements, Chriſt ſhewes in the parable <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 18. Some had oxen &amp; could not come, ſome had farmes and muſt be held excuſed; in generall euerie coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man hath ſome pulbacke from religion, or if happily ſometimes he doe ouercome that let by much a doe, &amp; ſtep into the Church dore and ſet him downe before the preacher, yet the holy Ghoſt tels vs how he is occupied, ſpeaking to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he ſayes that they ſat before him indeede, but though he was a man of rare gifts and verie eloquent yet their hearts went after their couetouſneſſe. So that a couetous mans heart is in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all trauaile, though his bodie ſit ſtill, for ſometime yet his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and thoughts are moyling and rotting into the earth; ſo that he can giue no attention to the word nor marke nothing that is ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But yeelde that ſometimes a quame of attention come ouer him, admit that he can frame to giue eare to that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto him, yet all is fruitleſſe, he gets no good, for theſe be the cares of this world that like thornes choake the good ſeede of the word that no fruite can come vp, and thus we ſee what miſcheefe a couetous heart bringes, that no meanes of God can worke any good vpon ſuch a man. Theſe thinges therefore being well weighed and pondered vpon, that will ſtaye one from theſe vaine deſires of theſe vanities, and fooliſh doating vpon theſe idle trifles, that a worldly man with ſo great paine doth hunt after.</p>
               <p>And now followes the publique and outward breach of this commandement in Church robberie. Firſt, and that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe finds fault with all, in <hi>Malac</hi> 3. where he charges them to haue robbed him, wherein ſay they? <hi>in tithes and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29174:160"/> ſaith God, ſo that to take to ones ſelfe thoſe thinges that God hath appointed to religious vſes and for his ſeruice; that is to rob and ſpoile God himſelfe, of that which he hath challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto himſelfe. And in the <hi>Prouebs. Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to deuoure things ſanctified.</hi> That is, to conuert things ſanctified and appointed for holy vſes vnto ones owne priuate commoditie, this is that which God abhorres. So for thinges pertaining to the commonweale, that is an other kinde of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique robberie; when a man which hath the diſpoſing &amp; orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thinges that pertaine to the commonweale and are to be vſed for the common good, will take them for themſelues and make a priuat gaine of them. This is a foule fault and an high degree of theft, ſo much the more hainous, becauſe it is more generall and a greater wrong, by how much it toucheth more, and becauſe theſe be theeues in requeſt, and robbers that are in credit, which deceiue thoſe that truſt in them, and deale ill and vnfaithfully with them that put co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in them, which doth much aggrauate the fault. For other kind of theeues thoſe that take a purſe by the way ſide, or that ſteale his ſheepe or Oxen out of his grounds, or pulle his cloths of the hedge, they deceiue no mans expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no man committed any thing in charge to them, nor looked for better at their hands; but he that is falſe to thoſe which are his friends and rely vpon, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtie to thoſe that truſt him, this is a right <hi>Iudas</hi> a theefe in a higher degree. Theſe two are publique, now for priuate ſtealth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the abuſing of ones owne goods, for a man may be a groſſe theefe in Gods account, though he neuer touch penny of mans goods, but only his owne goods. For as in the ſixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, he that kils himſelfe and is cruell to his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall not be exempted from the name and account of a murtherer, and in the ſeuenth commandement a man may be a filthy perſon and a vilde breaker of that commandement in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing his bodie himſelfe alone; ſo in this eight commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he that abuſeth his owne goods and robs himſelfe, is no better then a theefe before God. Now men abuſe their owne wealth
<pb facs="tcp:29174:161"/> by two waies; by waſtfulnes and niggardlyneſſe, by vniuſt ſpen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding and vniuſt ſparing. For lauiſh ſpending and waſtfulneſſe hath many branches, firſt, exceſſe in diet or in apparaile, in ſports or in building, aboue that, that one is able and can goe through with all. For exceſſe of diet, in meate and drinke, the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He that loues paſtime ſhall be a poore man and he that loues wine and oyle ſhall not be rich.</hi> When one is giuen to his appetite, and will too much pleaſe his tooth, when hee will fare well aboue his abilitie, and ſo ſpend all in ſummer and keepe nothing for winter, this man brings pouertie vpon him ſelfe and and robs his owne family.</p>
               <p>Theſe men are among their companions and mates termed good fellowes, and eſteemd as the only liberall and kinde hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men in the world, but God cals them theeues, and infidell theeues, yea worſe then infidell theeues, that haue ſo much caſt of ciuill honeſtie and humanitie, as that they haue no regard to their family. Alſo in apparell, if one will ſet out himſelfe to farre and ſpend more in decking his carcaſe, then hee can well ſpare, and lay all he can get vpon his backe: this man takes his owne purſe from himſelfe and caſts himſelfe into ſuch area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and runnes into ſuch debts and danger and brings ſuch a weight of miſerie vpon his one backe, as that a theefe could not doe him halfe the harme by cutting of his purſe or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it from him, then this prodigall humor of his doth, that he cannot be content with ſuch garments as beſeemes his place &amp; calling and abilitie, but muſt behang himſelfe with ſuch coſtly coates. This brings penury and want where God ſends none, therefore ſuch a man can giue no good account of his ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe but muſt be content to come in the rowe of theeues. Alſo in gamning, for a gameſter is a theefe whether he looſe or winne. <hi>He that loues paſtime ſhalbe a poore man,</hi> he beggers himſelfe when God requires no ſuch matter at his hands, but would haue him huſband his own ſo thriftily that he might liue comfortably of that portion which God giues him; what neede he then put that to the fall of the lott which God hath alreadie put out of doubt, and ſo to conuay his goods to an other by an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29174:161"/> vnlawfull meanes? Oh, but he is a gainer ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a theefe, for he ſhould not couet that which is an other mans mony or wealth. Who hath appointed ſuch kind of trafique or exchange where the one partie muſt receiue no competent and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble recompence for his goods? God hath appointed no ſuch manner of getting, and he that doth get by this meanes God hath branded it with a curſe, and no word of God, no man of God, or ſeruant of God will giue any allowance or profeſſe any bleſſing vpon this kinde of gaine, ſo that hauing no warrant for getting no comfort, in vſing no promiſe of bleſſing in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of ſuch goods, howe can hee free himſelfe from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull getting and though a more common and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued yet a wicked and condemned theft? So for ſpending to much on hawkes and hounds, this is to reſtraine ones owne hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercie and to giue the childrens bread to dogs, which Chriſt forbid. And though they ſay they haue enough for both, yet they cannot but giue leſſe to one, becauſe they beſtowe ſo much vpon the other, and they ſhould not beſtowe that vppon beaſtes, that they might better beſtowe vppon men.</p>
               <p>This then will be an ill aunſwere when they ſhall come before God to anſwere for the ſpending of theſe thinges, as certainly euery man (let him thinke what he will) muſt giue vp his reckoning and make his accounts how he hath laid out his wealth that God gaue him to glorifie him by. I ſay when they muſt come to anſwere to this queſtion. How haue you ſpent your wealth? This vpon my taſt, this to pleaſe mine eye, this to delight mine eares, and ſo much vpon an other delight, and this vpon an other ſport. But what haue you giuen to God? when I could haue any odd time I gaue now and then a penny to Chriſt; this is to giue the bread to the dogs and crummes to the children, as in truth moſt men doe. The full ſtreame and freeneſſe of their liberalitie runs to ſeruing of their luſt, but the ſparing gifts and pinching bountie that God muſt haue. And all theſe rob and couſen themſelues, and though they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to get mountaines of pleaſure yet the end ſhall be paine
<pb facs="tcp:29174:162"/> he that loues wine and oyle, and he that loues paſtime, what is his verdit, and what ſentence hath God ſet downe? He ſhalbe a needly fellow, and liue in want, pouertie is the beſt ende and eaſieſt puniſhment of this waſtfullneſſe, for want of moderation in meat, drinke, apparaile, and paſtime.</p>
               <p>An other kind of waſtfullneſſe is in idleneſſe. An idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a theefe, he puts his hand into his boſome and eates vp his owne fleſh. He conſumes himſelfe and is a waſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>and an idle perſon ſhall be clothed with rags.</hi> If one ſhould haue ſuch a companion, as when he came to him, ſhould find him ſufficiently furniſhed with reaſonable ſtore of goods to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe, but by that time they parted company, ſhould ſtrip him out of all, leaue him nothing, make him goe in a ragged coat, and leaue nothing behind him but want and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; would not one thnke this was but a couſening compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a theeuiſh fellowe? But ſo it ſtands with idleneſſe if that it keepe one companie a while and he will intertaine this gueſt into his heart, it will make a ſpeedie riddance of all, ſet him bare in apparell and baſe in account, and fill an houſe full of diſtreſſe and calamitie, that is founde full of wealth.</p>
               <p>And in truth, experience ſhewes this among vs daily, that if a man be left well and be of ſufficient wealth to maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in good ſort, let him but giue harbour to idleneſſe, and all flies away, it goes to wracke, and by little &amp; little like a moath it moolters away his great wealth, &amp; makes him no better then a begger afore it haue done with him, vnleſſe he ſhake it of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. And true it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>His pouertie comes like an armed man:</hi> Idle perſons be pouerties priſoners, if they haue no calling to ſettle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in, pouertie hath a calling to arreſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and if they can take vp themſelues in no lawfull buſineſſe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie comes with a commiſſion to take vp them, and will not be put backe neither, it comes armed, it will preuaile. So that an idle man is a theefe to himſelfe, he does that to himſelfe, that if another ſhould doe it, all men would take heed of him for a notorious couſener. And beſides 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. he condemnes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29174:162"/> ſuch as walke inordinately, and bids them labour with their hands, and not be idle, that they may eate their owne bread; as if he had ſaid, he that doth nothing, hath right to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he hath no bread of his owne to eate, he puts ſtolne meat into his mouth euerie bit he eates, he cannot ſay, Lord giue me this day my daily bread, for it is none of his, becauſe he neuer earned it, God will haue him doe ſomething afore he haue any thing. God indeed allowes recreation, he will haue it to fit vs for our calling not to hinder vs from it. And why doe we account any man a theefe, but becauſe he is a naughtie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he takes his neighbours meat and paies not for it, he takes his cloathes, and giues him nothing in recompence: and why then is not an idle man a theefe, for he takes his meat and his apparrell, and what euer he hath from an other without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without doing any thing for them; they be Gods, and God hath made no ſuch bargaine that he ſhall haue them without doing ſeruice to him, but when he leaues his calling, he looſeth his right and title, he liues of an others goods, &amp; ſhall anſwere for it as a theefe.</p>
               <p>A third thing wherein one plaies the theefe in his own goods is by ſuretiſhip. For <hi>Salomon</hi> names idleneſſe and ſuretiſhip as two ſinnes that men make little account of, but God doth marke them, and eſteemes them as foule faults. For this ſureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how euer men thinke it comes from a kinde nature, and a louing diſpoſition, that they would be willing to doe good to any; but it is nothing ſo, it proceeds from an vnwiſe heart, and a great meaſure of fooliſhneſſe for true kindneſſe at home, and loue if it be true loue, will doe moſt where it owes moſt, but this is a fooliſh crueltie when one vnder the ſhew of mercie to an other, will vndoe himſelfe and his wife and children. I ſpeake not this, but that a man may and ought to be ſuretie, and this is a dutie to be performed to a good man with a good calling; and according to ones abilitie, that he breakes not his owne backe with bearing an other mans burthen. Therefore in ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip keepe theſe two rules, firſt, looke what a kinde of man he is that you would paune your credit for, a man muſt not do
<pb facs="tcp:29174:163"/> his hand ouer his head for euerie one that will aske, but onely for ſuch as he is bound vnto by ſome bond of dutie, eyther for religion and charitie, or elſe for ſome knot of friendſhip or of kindred; elſe if one be ſo careleſſe to be ſuretie for he cares not who, <hi>Salomon</hi> takes his coat, pittie him not, let him feele the ſmart of his fooliſh and ſinfull raſhnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for whom euer it be, goe not aboue your abilitie, promiſe not for ſo much as might hurt your familie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre your eſtate if it muſt be taken from you, for when one is ſuretie, he bindes himſelfe to pay if the principall doe not, and if hee doe not meane to doe it, or cannot doe, this is a meere diſſembling and plaine couſenage of him to whom he makes the bond, and how can it be counted better then a lye when he promiſeth to doe that which he neither can performe though he would, nor purpoſeth to performe though he could. If any one therefore haue offended this way, let him know and confeſſe that it was his raſhneſſe and folly, and then his beſt way is to repent and craue pardon of God, and beſeech him to make a ſupplie of his wants. But ſo long as one continues theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, O I was deceiued, and I meant well, and I did it of good will; and he hath dealt ill with me, ſo long I ſay as one laies the fault vpon another thus, &amp; poſtes it of from himfelfe, ſo long he is farre enough from repentance, and ſhall be farre enough from comfort; the croſſe and curſe doe both remayne vpon as yet; that is not the way to lay it vpon another, it was long of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, and ill dealing with me; nay it was long of your owne vnfaithfulnes and ill dealing with your family, it was long of your wiſedome, that you did not aduiſe vpon the matter, craue aſſiſtance at Gods hands, and aske counſell of his word, and of his ſeruants. If you had taken this courſe which is the right courſe, you had beene ſafe, but now that you are falne, the beſt way is not to lye crying and exclaiming againſt him that was an occaſion of your fall, but ſeeke how to riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, take the right phiſicke, and goe to the right phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>God is the phiſition, &amp; true repentance, and prayer for helpe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29174:163"/> is the right medicine, and if one vſe theſe meanes, they ſhall find helpe, the hurt is cured. Thus much for waſtfulneſſe, the next is niggardlineſſe.</p>
               <p>A baſe couetous, needie, and euill eye, when one cannot finde in his heart to take his part of the things God hath beſtowed vpon him, but will ſerue and pinch himſelfe, and rob himſelfe of the vſe of that which he hath in his owne keeping, this is as bad as if he ſhould doe the ſame to an other; all is one to bring pouertie vpon an other by wronging him, and to bring a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe need vpon himſelfe by wronging himſelfe. It is a moſt miſerable and baſe thing for one to reſtraine himſelfe of his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full libertie in meat, drinke, apparell, and honeſt recreation, where God hath not abridged him. This ſinne the wiſe man ſets forth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 26. Where he ſpeakes of two ſorts of people, the one which God loues, and to thoſe he giues not onely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and aboundance of all things, but alſo the right and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of the ſame, that they ſhall be able with comfort to vſe that which God hath giuen them. But there is an other kind of people whom God hates, and how ſhall they ſpeed thus? They ſhall haue payne to gather and heape vp wealth which muſt be beſtowed vpon thoſe that be holy and good in Gods ſight. God hath certaine enemies in the world, vpon whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to be auenged in this life, and how will he plague them? This ſhall be their curſe, he will appoint them to be ſlaues and drudges, and lay vp wealth great ſtore, but they ſhall want a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and a good vſe, they ſhall toyle and moyle, and tumble and toſſe, and carke and care, and ſtruggle and ſtriue for earth, a great deale more then Gods children can doe for heauen, and when they haue beene at all this labour, and ſpent themſelues thus, they ſhall ſee no good day nor haue one houre of comfort, an other muſt enioy all.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 1. Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of the ſame ſinne, he cals it an euill ſickneſſe, a plague of the ſoule, and a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the conſcience. And yet it is verie common among men, that a man ſhould haue good and wealth enough, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to ſerue the husband and wife to ſpend to their daies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb facs="tcp:29174:164"/> together, and to ſuffice the parents to reioyce with their children, and gouernours, to liue quietly among and with their ſeruants, if they had a heart to take their part, but through the vnſatiableneſſe of the mind there are ſuch ſeares, ſuch cares, ſuch wiſhing, ſuch deſiring, ſuch wreſtling ſuch wrangling with wife, and chafing with ſeruants, that it is a houſe of diſquiet and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and in the midſt of all outward meanes of comfort, they liue all without comfort.</p>
               <p>This is a ſicke family, this houſe is infected with the plague of God, &amp; that vpon the ſoule, this is a moſt miſerable and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſeaſe. Therefore we muſt all learne to beware of this baſeneſſe, which is ordinarie with men of moſt abilitie; of all in the pariſh you ſhall haue them come ſeldomeſt to Church vpon the ſabboth daies, no more then needs they muſt, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the weeke day neuer at all, not once in a twelue month, and if you aske them, why? what is the reaſon, you can finde no leiſure to come to heare Gods word, and to ſeeke the meanes your ſaluation vpon the weeke daies? why alaſſe we haue ſuch a deale of buiſineſſe, ſo much rrouble, as that we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch it in anie time, we muſt needs follow our calling, and ſee to our houſehold, and thus commonly it is ſeene that thoſe which haue moſt land &amp; liuing, haue moſt paines and vexation, all lies vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all muſt come through their own hands, they haue no ſeruants, none to helpe themſelues, and they muſt needs looke to it; but who puts them to all this trouble, who laies ſuch a burthen vpon them? ſurely this it is that eyther they be ſo miſerable, and cloſe fiſted that ye will not lay out any thing to hire helpe, or elſe if they doe entertaine a ſeruant, they puniſh him ſo miſerably in his diet, &amp; deale ſo deceitfully with him in his wages, or oppreſſe &amp; ouercharge him ſo cruelly with labour, as that he that hath had experience of them one yeare, will not be perſwaded to liue with them the ſecond, and thus they trouble themſelues with plaine nigardiſe, and no neceſſitie that God hath impoſed vpon them. This men commonly call good husbandrie and thrift, for a man to lay about him ſo, and take on, and doe all himſelfe; but it is plaine theft before God,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29174:164"/> for one to ſpend himſelfe, &amp; pull a want vpon himſelfe, when he may liue in plenty, Gods marks be found vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for a wicked man, and a curſed ſinner, when he hath much, but can vſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. That he which hath a verie ſmall portion, may liue more comfortably, ſleepe more quietly, pray more cheerefully, and ſing Pſalmes with greater ioy, then he that hath ſo much abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as nothing hurts him but too much.</p>
               <p>Theſe therfore that be ſuch miſerable bondſlaues to lucre and couetouſnes, as that they be as much at the command of gaine, both for their bodie &amp; their ſleepe and euerie thing, as the ſaints of God be vnto Chriſt Ieſus, let them repent of there theeuerie, and not bragge of their honeſtie, &amp; ſay they will deſie him that will call them theeues, for then they muſt deſie God, for he will tell them they be theeues that will not thankefully vſe his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but pinch and ſterue themſelues. We would thinke that it were an ill member in the bodie that would not be content that any other member ſhould haue any thing, but would be ſcraping all to it ſelfe, and nothing was well which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon it. For the bodie hath ſeuerall parts, and euery one hath his proper vſe that is fitteſt for it ſelfe, and ſo in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, the husband and wife haue both their duities, and there is a place for ſeruants to, and thoſe that one for couetouſneſſe will weare himſelfe, and ſpend himſelfe, and ſpend his ſtrength and ſpirits, that all muſt goe through his hand, and nothing can be well, vnleſſe it be of his owne doing; this miſdeeming of others, and ouercharging of himſelfe is a damnable ſinne, and vnleſſe he repent for it, God will proceed againſt him at the day of iudgement, as againſt as baſe a theefe as any vnder heauen. Thus much for theft in ones owne goods. Now for theft of an other mans goods.</p>
               <p>And firſt, of that which is done with ſome colour of lawe and ſemblable ſhew of equitie and right. This is as bad &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a ſinne as the other that is done more openly, for in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters art and skill alwaies amends a thing, and makes it better, onely it makes ſinne farre worſe, and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is the moſt abhominable ſinner of all, becauſe he is the
<pb facs="tcp:29174:165"/> moſt ſubtill and artificiall ſinner of all. This kinde of deceiuing one vnder colour of law, and vnder ſhew of equall bargaining and couenant, to deale craftily &amp; againſt conſcience, is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible theft before God. And this is forbidden. 1. <hi>Theſſ. 6. That no man defraud or oppreſſe an other, for God is an auenger of all ſuch things.</hi> The Apoſtle condemnes this circumuenting and politique fetching ouer ones brother in vnequall matches. I but ſaies ſome man, may not I make the moſt of mine owne, and ſeeke my beſt aduantage? if he be hurt it is not my fault but his, he ſhould haue had more wit. Well this will not be a good anſwere to God ſaith the Apoſtle, he will tell you, that you ſhould haue had more loue, he is an auenger of all theſe things, and will plague thoſe that will gripe and pinch their neighbors thus, farre otherwiſe then themſelues would be dealt withall in the like caſe. So <hi>Iames.</hi> 5. 4. he bids ſuch <hi>howle and weepe, for the crie of thoſe labourers whoſe hire they had kept backe by fraud, is come into the eares of God.</hi> Elſe they might haue ſaid, what reaſon haue you to threaten vs thus, or they to crie againſt vs, or to hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues diſcontented, what wrong haue we done them? we require no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our bargain &amp; our couenant, we agreed for all that we aske, and what iniurie is that? ſaith the Apoſtle it may be ſo, but your agreement was deceitful, you kept it backe by fraud, you made a couſening and craftie bargaine, you plaid vpon your neighbours ſimplicitie, and abuſd his plainneſſe, you ſaw more then he did, and knew the inconuenience better then he could, you wrapt him by craft, you feared him by great words, that he durſt not yeelde, or you got him in by fayre promiſes, he lookt to be better vſed, and to haue ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in an other thing.</p>
               <p>This catching men by fraud, and hunting them with nets, this is a crying ſinne, and will let God haue no reſt till he take vengeance vpon thoſe that vſe it. And thus <hi>Ahab</hi> got <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard. He would faine haue it from him, &amp; would not take it from him by plain and open violence, for feare of the ſpeech of people and infamie in the world, but yet he was content to let <hi>Ieſabel</hi> haue his ring, and ſhe indites a verie coulerable and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29174:165"/> holy letter. There was an ill report of a foule fault done amongſt them, that <hi>Naboth</hi> ſhould be blaſphemer of Gods maieſtie, and a wicked traytor againſt his prince, but yet for feare leaſt mens tongues ſhould be ſlaunderous, and lies ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, a iudiciall proceeding muſt be taken, and leaſt any thing ſhould be done without aduice and good counſell, raſhly and headily, a faſt muſt be proclaimed, and the people muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, and there with faſting and prayer the thing muſt be tried orderly, and in forme of law. For good <hi>Ahab</hi> and good <hi>Ieſabel</hi> were loath to doe any wrong, or to iudge one vpon a falſe ſurmiſe and rumor; therefore that the truth might appeare, let the elders of the citie ſearch out the matter, and finde the truth in all equall manner, let the accuſers come face to face, and ſo let them according as they ſawe in conſcience they were bound, proceed to paſſe to ſentence. And ſo they did, and there were men at hand to forſweare themſelues, and now ſith that all things were ſo plaine and euident, and matters went ſo cleare againſt him, alaſſe they were ſorie but they could not choſe but deale indifferently, and according to law <hi>Naboth</hi> muſt haue that puniſhment that his foule fact deſerued, he muſt forfait his life and goods to the King. And thus <hi>Ahab</hi> got the vineyard. Heere we ſee was dawbing and painting with fayre ſhewes and goodly words, equitie, conſcience, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and all to carrie out murther and theft; but did this make it a whit the better? nay this made it farre more abhominable in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>So among vs, cruell encloſers that ſet themſelues to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people the land, and weaken the ſtrength of the countrey, by ioyning houſe to houſe, and land to land, indeede for houſes they doe not ſo muche delight in ioyning houſe to houſe as in pulling down houſes, but all the land they would by their good wil get into their owne hand. Theſe caterpillers what doe they? what ſay they? goodly words &amp; fayre pretences you ſhall haue. O this wil be for the good of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale &amp; of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, this will preuent much ſtrife &amp; contention, when things be parted, and euerie man knowes his owne, and they lie not
<pb facs="tcp:29174:166"/> in common thus, and beſide it will nouriſh wood, and I know not what; and thus vnder pretence of a common good ſeeke to get all to themſelues, and ſweepe out men from of the earth. Theſe commonly be great theeues, but there is a great iudge that will proceed againſt them, his word hath paſſed ſentence alreadie, and it ſhall not be long afore the execution come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuch as doe harme by colour of doing good. The like may be ſaid of thoſe that hauing the goods of men deceaſed put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands by will, deale vnfaithfully, and put them from the right owners into their owne purſe; this is plaine theft, and yet it goes for currant often among men, becauſe it takes ſome ſhew of warrant from the law of men, but Gods law will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it no colour. So <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of theft by buying and ſelling, it is naught, it is naught ſaith the buyer, but after he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, ſuch as will depreſſe a thing aboue meaſure, and againſt their conſcince and knowledge if they be to buy, but if they be to ſell will extoll and praiſe the ſame thing farre beyond that they know and perſwaded it is worth.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like practiſes, are cloſe and colourable that mans law doth not take ſo much holde vppon, but Gods law doth forbid and condemne. An other and the laſt kinde of ſtealth is with out all colour of law, when one will haue it, becauſe he will, though he can alledge no ſhadow of right or title to it. As by violence and ſtrong hand to take away that belongs not to one. This was the ſinne of <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> that when God had commaunded them to take ſodden meat they would haue it raw, and if the people ſaid, nay I pray you let God be ſerued, and let things be done according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, nay would they ſay, but if you will not giue it vs, we wil take it whether you will or no. Heere they could pleade no manner of intreſt, and therefore it is ſaid the ſinne of the young man was great in the ſight of God. So to ſteale by the high way ſide, and to take may mens cattle, or any ſuch like dealing. This is a knowne ſinne, and becauſe ſuch commonly haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but muſt needs plead guilty ſtraight; They are ſooneſt brought to repentance and amendment.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:29174:166"/>
               <p>An other kinde of lawfull ſtealing which is done without colour of right is more priuie and cloſſe, the former was violent and open, and that is either by taking or retaining. By taking when one layes theeuiſh hands on that thinge which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tels him, he hath no right vnto it, but it belongs altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to an other man; of this theft the Prophet ſpeakes. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. 5. That the curſe of God like a flying booke comes vpon the houſe of the theefe in the 2. 3. 4. verſe. I ſee a flying booke the length thereof is 20. cubits and the breadth of it 10. Then ſaid he vnto me, this is the curſe that goeth through the whole earth, for euerie one that ſtealeth ſhall be cut of, as well on this ſide as on that.</hi> And in the fourth <hi>verſe. I will bring it forth ſaith the Lord of hoſts and it ſhall enter into the houſe of the theefe and him that ſweareth falſely by my name, and it ſhall remaine in the midſt of his houſe and it ſhall conſume it with the timber of it, and the ſtones of it.</hi> The Prophet ſhewes that the curſe of God followes ſuch as ſteale, and bee theeues; ſwiftly it flies after them and God himſelfe will bring it into their houſes, and when it is there, it is like the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent fretting leproſie that was not only infectious to men but would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume the howſes &amp; enter into the timber and ſtones. So Gods curſe doth not reſt vpon the bodie and ſoule only of theeues and thoſe that will ſteale, but it will bring all to naught, vnleſſe he purge it away by true repentance; A man were as good put a cole of fire in the thatch of his houſe or in the barne as bring any ſtolne goods among his ſtuffe. Firſt, he ſaith, the man that ſteales ſhall be cut of, he prouokes God to deale with his perſon firſt, and to cut him of, to kill his bodie and damne his ſoule; why but though I be dead and gone, yet I hope my family and my children after me ſhall fare the better for mee; No, they ſhall fare the worſe for it, for Gods curſe that ſhall purſue them is ſuch a deuourer and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumer, that though there ſhould be no man or leaſt no liuing thing left for it to worke vpon, yet it would not reſt but ſhew it vpon the dumbe things vpon the verie thatch and the timber &amp; the ſtones of the houſes of ſuch as haue prouoked God to lay it vpon them, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Abacuc</hi> ſaith. 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. He that coueteth an euill coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:29174:167"/> to his houſe, not to himſelfe only. Men thinke when they can bring home thoſe ſtolne goods, that this is a good thing, and ſhall doe them and theirs good, but indeede it is an ill couetouſneſſe, it brings a miſcheefe vpon him and his houſe, ſo many thinges as a man gets by ſtealth from his neighbour, ſo many curſes he gets to his ſoule, and ſo many plagues he wraps and rowles together to come vpon his poſteritie. So that to be prigging and pilfering of that belonges not to him, nor is not his due, is a foule ſinne againſt this commandement. Yet men haue excuſes for this prigging.</p>
               <p>As firſt, alaſſe what ſhould you ſpeake of this it is a ſmall thing &amp; one ſhould not make ſuch a doe about ſo little a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Is' it a ſmall thing? Then ye more baſe and abiect compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you that will corrupt your ſelfe for ſo ſmall a thing, he that will racke his conſcience for a triffle, he will neuer ſticke to do fiue times worſe for a matter of weight. If a man be not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a little, you may be ſure he will neuer be faithfull in much; he that will venture da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation for a matter of two pence, he will doe ten times more if it come to a pound, he that cares not to breake Gods commandement for a peece of breade, let him haue hope of a greater bootie, and he will not care for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. If one will doe the Diuell ſuch good ſeruice for ſo ſimple and ſmall wages, let the diuell mende his wages, and he will certainely mende his worke. So that this excuſe ſhews a man to be more wicked. Oh but I truſt this is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, why he can ſpare it well enough, twill doe him no harme, and twill doe me good, I hope this is no ſuch matter. But firſt, who made you a deuider of goods, who gaue you authoritie to make any ſuch partition? Hath not God giuen him that which is his, and you that which is yours, and will you haue God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and not contented with Gods diſtributions, take that which belongs not to you? and for that you ſay he can ſpare it, it will doe him no harme; ſuppoſe one ſhould goe to the Kings exchequer and breake open his treaſure, and take out, though it were but twentie ſhillings or fortie ſhillings, and ſay, alaſſe I am a poore man and this is not ſo much, the Kinge is rich en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29174:167"/> hee may well ſpare twice ſo much, I truſt hee will not be much offended, though I haue ventured a little in my neede. But for all your neede and the princes wealth, he that would doe thus, were like to be counted a foole and be hangd for his pains, the excuſe would not ſerue the turne; but now god he hath forbidden you to take any mans goods without any ſuch cauſe of exception vnleſſe he can ſpare it; that is not the queſtion, whether it will hurt him or not, it offends God, he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it and therefore you muſt not doe it.</p>
               <p>And where as you ſay, it will doe you good, and helpe you, that is not true, it will hinder you rather and brings a further curſe on you then afore. I but what courſe would you haue a man take? the world hath forſaken me, I haue no freind to helpe me, what would you haue me doe? what? why rather any thing then this. Haue men forſaken you, and will you make God forſake you to? you can haue no helpe in the world, and will you therefore ſhut vp heauen againſt your ſelues to? if one were helpleſſe and freindleſſe here and knewe not which way to turne himſelfe for releefe &amp; ſuccor, yet if he could turne to god and run to heauen, &amp; haue hearing there &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort from thence, that God did heare his prayers and giue peace vnto his ſoule, his caſe is good, and he is well ſo long. But nowe when one is quite out of hope among men, and deſtitute of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort, then for him to make God his vtter foe, and fill him ſelfe with inwarde euils and greefes to, this is a faire mending of the matter indeede, this is a wiſe kinde of helpe.</p>
               <p>Therefore aboue all, then a man had moſt neede to keepe peace and league with God when the world hath caſt him of, and if God doth chaſtice him with want, it were a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe to repent, and entreat God to helpe him, and turne away his heauie hand, then to adde more to his ſinne, and ſo cauſe God, to adde more ſtrokes and correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to thoſe that he hath alreadie laide vpon him. So that whether the thing be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or greate, what euer a mans eſtate be, or who euer hee be whome he wrongs, he muſt alwaies take heede of this
<pb facs="tcp:29174:168"/> priuie ſtealth, of this prigging and cloſe conueying an other mans goods to himſelf. Now as this is fault to any, ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the perſon to whome the wrong be done, be more nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ioyned and tied in any bonds to vs or we to them, contrarie to the dealing of a number, that indeede will let their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods alone for ſome outward reſpect, they will not ſteale from them, but for their parents or maſters, there you muſt giue them leaue they hope they may borrow law a little, and be ſome thing bolder with their goods, then with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But doe they not know what the holy Ghoſt ſaith in the <hi>prouerbs, he that robs his father and mother, and ſaith it is noe ſinne, is a ſhamefull and a lewd ſonne.</hi> For this is ſo farre from leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fault, that in truth before God it makes it farre more haynous and abominable. For as he that kils his father or his maſter, doth commit a farre greater ſinne, then if hee were a ſtranger or one further of, ſo here to, he that robs his father or his maſter, is in an higher degree a ſinner, then if it were a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nothing ſo neere vnto him, to whome he did not owe ſo much dutie.</p>
               <p>Therefore as one muſt labour, not to let his hands haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to take in any thing that belongs to any man, be he neuer ſo farre diſtante from him, ſo eſpecially he muſt reſtraine them from that which belongs to his father or maſter, or ſome ſuch to whom he was bounde with a more ſtrong and neere bonde then to other men; for it is a more wicked ſtelth, that is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a freinde, then that againſt a ſtraunger. And thus much for ſtealth by taking.</p>
               <p>Now an other kind of theeuerie there followes nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to this, by vnlawfull retaining and keeping in ones hand that which is none of his. Whether it be with holding of things found or lent, or of wages or thinges that way due vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For though a man keepe himſelfe vnſpotted in this reſpect that no man can charge him to haue taken away one pennie from his neighbour either priuily or violently, yet if hee going by the way ſide finde a thing that he knowes not whoſe it is, then when he takes it vp, and after heares who is the right ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29174:168"/> of it, and doth not reſtore his owne goods to him againe, all his former good dealing in other things will not excuſe him from being accounted a theefe, and ſtealing from his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For God hath commanded to bring backe the thing that goes aſtray, and to make reſtitution of that which is loſt; and if he did not ſo, before his offering could be accepted, he was to reſtore the principall and adde the fifth parte more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>For indeede his conſcience will accuſe him and the verie law of nature will condemne him. Becauſe there is no man ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but if he hath loſt his purſe or any thing by the way ſide or any other way, would thinke it right and equall that hee who found it, ſhould bring it to him againe if he knew him to be the owner of it, and would ſay he had not done the dutie of a neighbour if he ſhould keepe it backe from him. Now, God commands to doe as we would be done by, and therefore this that he would be ſo dealt with all, binds him to deale ſo, and if he doe not he ſinnes againſt his owne conſcience, and that ſhall be ſufficient to condemne him. So for wages, he that doth not pay his ſeruants or the hireling his due wages, in due time, without ſhifting and putting of from time to time, he is giulty of theft, and this is a groſſe kind of ſtealing, breaking this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Thou ſhalt not ſteale. This delay is theeuerie, though one doe purpoſe to pay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, and that rather with the moſt to, then, to keepe any backe, if he be poore and not able to forbeare this protracting from time to time is no better then plaine theft. This is forbidden, <hi>Leuit. 19. 13. Thou ſhall not rob thy neighbour,</hi> ſaith God. But one might ſay I doe not rob him, nor I will not, for he ſhall haue his goods ſafe enough by me, I will take nothing from him that is his, then ſaith he again. <hi>Let not the hirelings wages reſt with thee till morning,</hi> as if he had ſaid though you doe not take his mony, yet if you keepe it from him. I account it robbeerie, for the ende of his worke ſhould be the beginning and performing of his wages; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the worke is done, let not the wages tarrie one day in your purſe, for it is none of yours, it is your hirelings. So
<pb facs="tcp:29174:169"/> 
                  <hi>Deut, 24. 14. Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſeruant that is needie. Thou ſhalt giue him his hire for the day, neither ſhall the ſunne goe downe vpon it, for he is poore, and therewith ſuſtaineth hee his life.</hi> If one be poore and in diſtreſſe, and he cannot beare with this delay but is put to his ſhifts, and made to endure hunger and colde, and to goe from him with an heauie heart when hee is not paid, and with a Sighe not knowing what to doe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe; this is both crueltie in that he keepes that from him that ſhould maintaine his life, and it is theft alſo in that it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt detaining of that which is done to the hindrance of him to whome it appertaineth. So that this kind of ſhifting and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the hireling with ſuch delayes, is a fault that makes the man guiltie of theft, before God. Thus much for the thinges forbidden in this commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The things commanded, are EitherInwarde or Outwarde</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inward dutie, is contentedneſſe with ones owne eſtate, with that portion whatſouer that God hath allotted vnto vs. To like ſo well of Gods deuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that we beleeue in our hearts that that meaſure is beſt and moſt profitable for vs, that God our moſt mercifull father hath appointed for vs. This quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with that part that fals to his ſhare, is the dutie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to euerie man, and is is the inward keeping of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. This is commanded. <hi>Heb. 13. 5. Let your conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be without couetouſneſſe.</hi> This is the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt. Why might ſome men ſay, I am not couetous, that you may trie ſoone, and be content with thoſe thinges that yee haue; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo farre as a man is voide of couetouſneſſe, ſo farre hee is well content with that which he hath, and he that doth not thinke his owne enough for himſelfe, it is ſure hee is couetous after an other mans, I but how is it poſſible that one can bee contented? I haue ſo many wants &amp; can ſee no meanes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, how would you haue one contente now, and hath not enough maintenance, nor cannot tell how to get it? Nay
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29174:169"/> if one be a chriſtian he hath enough to maintaine him, for hee hath the promiſe of God not to leaue him nor forſake him, and is Gods promiſe nothing? is not his word ſufficient aſſurance of all thinges needefull? if God haue bid one be content, and giuen him cauſe to be content, why ſhould not he be content, is not his truth pawne good enough? what is to be beleeued, &amp; whereupon may one depend, if not vpon the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God?</p>
               <p>For mans life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth not in the greatneſſe of his portion or the multitude of his wealth, but in the bleſſing of god which will make a little goe farre, &amp; doe more good then a great deale with out it, and he that hath this, what euer outward wants ſeeme to be, he is well. Indeede if the promiſe were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your welth ſhall not faile and friends ſhall not forſake you, this were no great cauſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, here a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not but feare when his ſaftie conſiſted in the conſtancie of ſuch vnconſtant thinges. But if God hath promiſed to be with vs what ſhould we feare, what any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can doe againſt vs? So <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, that he had learnd in all thinges to be content, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. This is a point of great learning, and he is a good ſcholler in Chriſts ſchole that hath gone ſo farre, as that he can like well of Gods doinges whatſoeuer. This is a thing that only Gods ſpirit can teach one to be ſo well apaide with his owne, as that he doe neither enuie at this, that an other hath more, nor repine, and grudge that himſelfe hath leſſe.</p>
               <p>But if this be ſuch a point of learning howe ſhould man come to it? That <hi>Paule</hi> ſhewes in. 1. <hi>Tim. 6. Godlineſſe is great gain, if he a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with that he hath.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it makes man contented with that he hath. So farre as any man is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo farre is he content with his outward eſtate, though hee haue but a little he is not much troubled, for he knowes Gods hand is not ſhortned, and if he had nothing, he would not be out of heart, &amp; diſmaid, becauſe he perſwades himſelfe Gods bleſſing can ſuſtaine him as well without means as with means. And this was that, that made <hi>Paule</hi> ſo quiet and ſetled in all caſes. For before Godlineſſe had calmed his heart hee was as
<pb facs="tcp:29174:170"/> vnquiet as the ſea, and troubled all the world with his raging and diſcontendneſſe, none more boyſtrous then: But ſo ſoone as hee grewe godly, all theſe ſtormes were quieted, none more quiet and contented then hee, if they impriſoned him, if they whipt him, if they ſtond him; hunger, cold, nakedneſſe, what euer came, all is one to him, it was no great trouble to him, he knew all came from God, and for his good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neuer ſtormd nor tooke on for the matter, but poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed his ſoule in patience, and knew how to beare all thinges quietly.</p>
               <p>Therefore whoeuer would be patient let him labour to get godlineſſe into his heart, many there bee that be willing, and will take paines enough to ſtore their purſes and their grounds, and their houſes, but fewe there bee that will take paines where it were moſt behouefull, to ſtore there hearts with godlineſſe, which would bring contentedneſſe, and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to, for we haue the promiſe of God, that if wee ſeeke the kingdome of God, we ſhall haue all other things caſt vpon vs as a vantage, And the cauſe why God doth reſtraine vs, is not becauſe he wants loue and cannot finde in his heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them, but becauſe they would be ill for vs and we could not them beare, he would haue vs bee good within, before vve ſeeke good vvithout, and know how to vſe riches, afore vve haue them to abuſe. Therefore as vve vvould not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theeues and breakers of this commandement, ſo let vs, be content to liue at Gods finding, and to reſt vpon him, ſo good a God, that though we haue but a little, yet he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and though he giue vs nothing before hande, yet hee loues vs before hand, and will giue vs comfort in all diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and theſe outwarde thinges ſo farre as we haue neede and can digeſt. Thus much for the inward obedience, nowe the outward followes and this is the right vſe of our owne, and the righteous dealing towards others.</p>
               <p>The right vſe of our owne is ſeene in frugalitie and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Frugalitie that ſtands in getting and keeping: getting things muſt be by ſome faithfull labour in an honeſt calling, and by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29174:170"/> honeſt dealing in the calling: <hi>As Epheſ. 4. 28. Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, but labour with his hands that thing that is good.</hi> To theeuerie which is a breach of this commandement, and idleneſſe which is a kinde of theft, he oppoſeth labour, and the keeping of the commaundement, but then he ſhewes what kinde of labour it muſt be, namely in the thing good, in ſome lawfull and chriſtian calling. For many labour all day, and all night, but that is in dicing and carding, and gamning, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſſe which will neither make them haue an heart to doe good, nor abilitie to doe good, but brings a curſe vpon heart and eſtate, the one is wicked, and the other commonly weake as is to be ſeene in ſtage players and ſuch like that drawe the people away to vanitie, which take paines indeed, but is is no profitable paines, and therefore it brings no profit, eyther to their ſoule or bodie, but brings them an hard heart and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hand, and a miſerable eſtate, that of all men they are the moſt prophane and lewde. Therefore as a man muſt not be idle, for an idle man cannot be an honeſt man, ſo this muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be prouided, that, he labour in an honeſt and lawful thing elſe one may toyle and ſpend his bodie in toyling, and be neuer a whit the honeſter man, if he ſerue not God, but ſerue his luſt and filthie fleſh. <hi>Eſau</hi> could take paines, and that eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till he was almoſt dead with labour, but it was in hunting, in following his fooliſh ſport, in this he would ſpend himſelfe, for he ſaith, I am almoſt dead, and he was ſo faint that he would ſell his birth right for a meſſe of pottage to refreſh him, all this while he was as bad as idle, becauſe he was ill occupied, and and this was a curſed labour. For God would haue one labour in ſuch a calling as ſhould humble his fleſh, and pull downe and tame his pride, and make him fit for death, and as would bring ſome encreaſe vnto his outward eſtate, and better him in his wealth, ſo that he might haue where-withall to ſhew mercie as haue a mercifull affection. This God hath appointed, and theſe wil be the effects of a godly labour. But this wearying ones ſelfe in ſlauerie to his luſts, and ſeruing himſelfe, it humbles one not a whit, nay it makes one more proud, more ſurly, and more
<pb facs="tcp:29174:171"/> aſſociable that one neither knowes God nor himſelfe, it doth not prepare him to die, but it makes him forget his latter ende, and neuer thinke of death, it makes not the heart pitifull and mercifull, but it hardens the heart, and infects it with crueltie, and ſuch an one as is not made by his labour able and willing to giue more, but able and willing to giue nothing at all. So that euery man muſt labour, no man hath any warrant or priuiledge to be idle, that is to be a Sodomite. And furthermore, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man muſt looke that his vocation be honeſt and lawfull, or elſe hee ſhall doe himſelfe more harme then good by his labour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point of liberalitie is in keeping that prudently and diſcreetly, which was honeſtly gotten, for if labour in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be not ioyned with wiſedome in preferring and ſauing, that is no good thrift, neither muſt this be a niggardly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſparing, but an orderly and wiſe diſpoſing and husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that which God hath put into our hands, that he may be better able to doe good, and to releeue others. In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie fayle, and by fayling in it, are faultie in a good dutie as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie as the former; yea labour indeed, and that with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and carefulneſſe, till they haue gotten ſomething, but let it goe as faſt, eyther by drinking or gamning, or elſe by good cheere and daintie fayre aboue their abilitie, and by this immoderate vndiſcreet lauiſhneſſe, they vndoe whatſoeuer they did before by following their calling, and keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alwaies in want and penurie, whereas if they would be as careful to keepe thriftily, as they be painefull to get, they might liue of their labours comfortably and ioyfully, and beſides might be much beneficiall to other that ſtood in neede, and haue wherewithall to open their hand liberally in workes of mercie.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Prouerb. 21. 20. In the houſe of a wiſe man is a pleaſant trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and oyle, but a foole deuowreth it.</hi> A wiſe man that is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, doth not onely ſeeke and bring into his houſe, but will alſo keepe in his houſe, a pleaſant treaſure, delightfull ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſuch as being gotten without any ſtaine of vniuſtice, hee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29174:171"/> hath delight and comfort, and a bleſſing in the vſe of them, and he hath not for neceſſitie onely, but alſo for delight euen oyle and things for refreſhing and recreation. But a foole that is a wicked and an vngodly man, he deuoures all, what euer it be left him by his parents, giuen him by his friends, or gotten by his labour, all goes one way, all is deuoured, all is ſpent idlely, and without any diſcretion, for he ſerues ſuch a chargeable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as will leaue him nothing at the yeares end. Other maſters vſe to giue their ſeruants wages for their worke, but the diuell and luſt whom wicked men ſerue, be both coſtly and hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they will take all; and ſo long as there remaines any thing to be had, they ceaſe not calling for it, but all this hard and chargeable paines ſhall be rewarded with nothing but want and neceſſitie at the laſt. So that a good man muſt be as well a keeper as a gayner, he muſt know how to bring in lawfully, and how to lay out with ſuch diſcretion, and to diſpoſe things in that good order, that he do not bring himſelfe into vnneceſſary wantes and troubles, but that he may haue both to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfe, and alſo to refreſh others. Thus much for thriftineſſe.</p>
               <p>The other thing required in the right vſe of ones owne goods is liberalitie, without which there is no true obedience to this commaundement. Now this liberalitie muſt ſpread it ſelfe in two braunches towards one ſelfe, and towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. A liberall man muſt be liberall to himfelfe, for all goodneſſe begins at home, and ſhewes it ſelfe firſt where it was firſt bred. And ſo <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 17. This is good he ſaith, to eate, and drinke, and take pleaſure in ones labour, and this he ſaith is the gift of God. To haue meat and drinke, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, is a thing common to reprobates, but to haue theſe things, and the right vſe of them alſo in ioy and comfort, and thankfulneſſe, this is a ſpeciall fauour, and a thrift not common to many.</p>
               <p>Therfore it is our duty to take a part of thoſe things that God hath giuen vs, and with a thankefull and a cheerefull heart to enioy his kindneſſe, and not to make our caſe worſe then we
<pb facs="tcp:29174:172"/> need, as the fooliſh Iſraelites did, that when God in goodneſſe had prouided ſufficient food for them, that they might haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and gone to bed cheerefully after a good and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſupper, they were ſo fearefull and doubtfull leaſt they ſhould haue had nothing for morning, that they pinched themſelues of Gods allowance, and would needs reſerue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vntill the morning. But what came of it, did not God ſend vvormes amongſt it, ſo that it ſtanke and was good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? and ſo it is ſtill, this is a thing perpetuall to the end of the world, that he which will be a more niggardly then God would haue him, and ſpares more then God hath laid neceſſitie vpon him, the curſe of God vvill fall vpon the goods thus ſaued, that it vvere as good as they had beene ſpent, for they ſhall corrupt and vaniſh away to nothing, he that ſpares thus, ſhall neuer haue any good by them, that is moſt ſure. And indeed if one doe not firſt ſhew mercie to himſelfe, how is it poſſible hee ſhould ſhew mercie to an other? he that vvill ſterue and pine himſelfe, vvhen he needs not, no man vvill truſt him to feede and relieue his neighbour vvhen he needs, this is moſt certaine he that vvill be cruell to his ovvne fleſh can neuer haue any true pittie to an other.</p>
               <p>Therefore firſt a man muſt haue an open hand to miniſter vnto his ovvne neceſſitie, and to helpe himſelfe, firſt ſee that himſelfe be the better for his owne goodneſſe and liberalitie. And yet that is not enough neither, a man muſt not ſpend all his kindneſſe within doores, and keepe ſo ſpare a fire that can vvarme no bodie but himſelfe, but after he muſt ſtretch out his hand to be bountiful to others, vvhoſe vvant requires his helpe, and vvhoſe penurie cals for ſome thing of his aboundance. So 1: <hi>Timoth. 6. 17. Charge thoſe that be rich in this world, that they be not high minded &amp;c. That they doe good, and be rich in good works.</hi> He would haue rich men not to truſt in riches but in God, for riches be vncertaine, and what greater folly can be then for a man to put his confidence in that which muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he knowes not how ſoone? God vvill call for him, and he muſt leaue his riches behinde him, and come naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29174:172"/> the iudgement ſeate of God. But if they would know how to vſe riches well, let it not be in putting truſt in them, or in looking bigge, and proud, and ſowre, for this will make them hatefull to God and man, but let them be mercifull, let them doe good and diſtribute, and this will be a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for themſelues, by ſo doing they ſhall be loued both of God and man, no better treaſure againſt an euill day then that which hath beene laid vp in works of mercie. So in <hi>Prouerbs. 11. 17. He that is mercifull rewardeth his owne ſoule.</hi> This is the benefit of mercie that one doth two good things at one time, he ſtops two gaps with one buſh, he both helpes and comforts his diſtreſſed, which is his owne fleſh, and more then that, he furthers his owne reckoning againſt the time of account. For when God ſhall come to take a view, and ſearch how euerie man hath ordred the goods committed to his hand, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will one day, let fooliſh men promiſe to themſelues what libertie they will, and flatter themſelues that all is their owne, and euerie one may doe with his owne what he will; yet they ſhall finde it is Gods, and to be vſed and diſpoſed according to his will, and when ſuch an inquirie comes, this will bring moſt vnſpeakable comfort to a mans ſoule, when vpon his death-bed and when he is now to leaue his wealth, he can with a good conſcience repeat to God how he vſed his wealth, and can hold vp his head before God and ſay, Lord, thine it was, and I did know I was but a ſteward, and therefore I diſpoſed of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my maſters will, I ſpent it not in ſeruing my luſtes and mad deſires, but in the ſeruice, and to the glorie of God, I was more willing &amp; readie to lay out twelue pence to Gods glorie, and the releeuing of a poote member of Chriſt that ſtood in need, then one pennie in ſetting vp my fleſh, and pleaſing the vaine and fooliſh affections of my fleſh: when one can thus ſpeake to God, and make ſuch a reckoning, he ſhall then well perceiue and feele, to the exceeding ioy of his heart, what reward he gets to himſelfe, that giues an almes, and ſhewes mercie liberally to an other.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he that ſoweth plentifully
<pb facs="tcp:29174:173"/> ſhall reape plentifully, comparing liberalitie in works of mercy to ſowing, and ſo it is indeed and ſhall yeeld a better and more plentifull crop, by how much the ſeed it ſelfe, and the ground on which it is ſowed is better then any other. So <hi>Oſe.</hi> 37. <hi>The righteous is mercifull and lendeth, and his ſeed inioyeth the bleſſing:</hi> meeting with an obiection that ſeemes to ariſe indeed, I would faine be mercifull and doe good, I know it is a good thing, but alaſſe I haue charge, I muſt prouide for my children, the father muſt lay vp for the children, and he is worſe then an infidel that prouides not ſomthing for his family But God wil haue one lay vp and prouide, and ſtore ſomething for his poſteritie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bids him be merciful, for he will neuer bequeath a better portion, and a richer legacie to his ſeed, then when he doth many works of mercy, euen for their ſakes, for God promiſeth they ſhall enioy the bleſſing of their goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>He ſaies not they ſhall be rich and haue the world at will, for a man may liue in as much eaſe and wealth, and pleaſure as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues</hi> did, and yet goe to hell when he dies; but they ſhall haue the bleſſing which imports thus much, they ſhall haue Gods fauour to bring them to heauen, he will bleſſe their ſoule and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and they ſhall haue beſide ſo much wealth as may ſtand with this bleſſing. Not ſo much as to make them proud &amp; idle, for that were the way to make them curſed, but ſo much as ſhal haue Gods fauour to bring them to heauen, he would bleſſe their ſoule and conſcience, and they ſhall haue beſide ſo much as may ſtand with this bleſſing, not ſo much as to make proud and idle, for that were the way to make them curſed, but ſo much as ſhall ſuffice to make them thankefull, and profitable in the Church. And this bleſſing they ſhall haue not as a gueſt to ſalute them and away, but as an inheritance that ſhal abide with them, and helpe them for euer. Thus much for the right vſe of ones owne.</p>
               <p>Now followes the next point in the right cariage of our ſelues towards our neighbours, and that is called Iuſtice, which conſiſteth in two things, in getting and reſtoring. Iuſtice in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is when one gets by lawfull meanes in a lawfull calling.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:29174:173"/>
               <p>Not by gamning and ſuch meanes, without any ſufficient conſideration and exchaunge; for this is theft, theſe be curſed meanes, that bring a curſe vvith the vnlawfull gaine, and ſuch a man makes himſelfe excommunicate in the hearts of Gods people, and brings hardneſſe of heart vpon himſelfe, and much miſchiefe beſide. But if the calling wherein a man exerciſeth himſelfe, be warranted and ſanctified of God to this vſe, then care muſt be had, and that as much that the meanes which one vſeth in his calling be agreeable, if it be by diſſembling, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by falſe weights or falſe meaſures, by falſe commending or diſcommending aboue meaſure, or by any ſuch like vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable waies, this is vniuſtice and a breach of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore let the calling be good, and the meanes good, and then a man may with a good conſcience take the bleſſing. And this is iuſtice in getting: now for reſtoring. This muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be obſerued, that if any haue in former time beene craftie and deceitfull, and dealt iniuriouſly with his neighbour, though happily it be hidden from men, and the world cannot lay it to his charge, yet his owne heart knowes it, and his owne conſcience will not paſſe it ouer ſo, but he muſt heare of it. If I ſay ones ſoule tell him that he hath thus wrongfully entreated his neighbour, if he will be accounted a iuſt man, and haue the former offence blotted out, and the mouth and clamour of his conſcience ſtopt from thoſe fierce and bitter accuſations whereby it vexeth and diſquieteth vnrepentant ſinners, he muſt ſee that he make reſtitution; let the ſeruant goe to the maſter and the goods returne home to the owner who hath the right title vnto them. This is commaunded. <hi>Leuit. 6. 2. If any ſinne and committ a treſpaſſe againſt the Lord, and denie vnto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that which was taken him to truſt, &amp;c. then in the firſt verſe he ſhall both reſtore it in the whole ſumme, and adde the fifth part more thereto.</hi> Where the holy Ghoſt appointeth that if a man haue beene any way iniurious to his neighbour, eyther by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that which was lent him, or hauing found a thing loſt, and knowing the owner, by retayning it, or by any other ſuch like dealing, if euer he will haue God heare his prayer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:29174:174"/> his ſacrifice, before his offering he muſt make recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the entereſt and the fifth part, &amp;c. I but he is gone, I know him not, or cannot tell where to haue him, I but doe you know none of his kinred, hath he no ſonne, or nephew, or brother, is there none neere vnto him that you know? not one. Yet it muſt be reſtored, it is none of yours, you muſt not keepe it, you of neceſſitie muſt part with it if you will haue the ſinne pardoned. Therefore you muſt giue it to the Lord, the Church muſt haue it. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 8. So that this is the law of reſtitution. He that hath gotten any thing vnlawfully muſt not onely ſay indeed I haue done amiſſe, I crie God mercie for that that is paſt, and I will doe ſo no more, but for this I hope GOD will pardon me, I purpoſe now to leaue of doing wrong to any. No this is not enough, a man muſt reconcile himſelfe to GOD, before he can reconcile his conſcience to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, God will not be aunſwered with ſuch a weake amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, there can be pardon, or perſeuerance vnleſſe there be true repentance, and true repentance neuer goes before, but ſoone after you ſhall ſee reſtitution follow. Therefore let a man deale more ſoundly in ſuch caſes, that pertaine to the peace of his conſcience; this hollow heartedneſſe and hypocriſie in ſuch matters will bring no peace, therefore let not a man hearken to the diuell and his owne fleſh for his hurt, and reſtore that which he hath defrauded any man of by ill meanes. If not, let him know for a ſurety, who euer he be, that there is no thriuing by ſuch dealing, ſinne is a poyſon infecting both the ſoule and bodie and eſtate, and vnleſſe it be purged out in time, will bring all to ruine.</p>
               <p>But yet ſome obiections ſeeme to ariſe; firſt, the thinge is of ſome price and the perſon is wicked, and would be willing to take the aduantage and follow the occaſion to put me to death.</p>
               <p>Therefore here danger ſeemes to ſtoppe ones mouth, and it were better to liue in ſaftie then to make reſtitution with perill of his life. But though the caſe ſhall fall out thus, yet the law of reſtitution admits no ſuch exception, one muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, yet wiſdome muſt be vſed in this caſe, that both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29174:174"/> offended may be ſatiffied and the partie which hath offended may be in ſaftie. Therefore ſome other third perſon of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and grauitie, a man of good account for religion and honeſtie, muſt be choſen, to whom the ſecret may be without perill reuealed, and by whoſe meanes the wrong done may bee fully anſwered; and he muſt reſtore it in the name of the other concealing his name and particular fault, as thus he may ſpeake. There is a man that in time of his ignorance hath wronged and endamaged you, and now that God hath touched his heart with true repentance, he is willing to ſatisfie you to the full, and therefore hath by me ſent you ſo much as will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommpence your loſſe, yet he deſires to conceale his name becauſe of perill that might enſue.</p>
               <p>By ſome ſuch wiſe and godly courſe, amends might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to the partie that ſuſtaind the wrong and he that did the wrong be nothing at al enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gered, for by Gods bleſſing no man is ſo malitious, but by the wiſdome and godly counſell of the man that is imployed in this thing, and the full ſatifaction and good dealing of the man that did wrong him, would haue held himſelfe contented without any further proſecuting of reuengment. But there comes yet a further doubt. I am not able to reſtore, I haue not where withall. Then where nothing is to be had, (it is a common prouerbe,) the prince muſt looſe his right. But yet ſo that a man muſt plainly and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his fault if there be not abilitie for reſtitution; yet a man muſt not neglect confeſſion, and this further, a man muſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelfe, that if euer it pleaſe god to giue him abilitie, he will be anſwerable to the full to all ſuch wrongs, and then as we are in affection, ſo God will account vs indeed. If one can ſay in truth of heart, O Lord I confeſſe my fault to thee, and haue confeſſed it alſo to the perſon whome I haue offended, and though I be not able to recompence him, yet I reſolue with my ſelfe and make a couenant with mine owne conſcience, That if euer I haue it, I will paye him, and if I had it nowe, I would differ no longer, hee ſhould haue it nowe, in meane time I will not ceaſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb facs="tcp:29174:175"/> that by my prayers, which by reaſon of pouertie is wanting in my payment, that mine humble ſuite to God for him, may as much profit him as my ſinne againſt God, and againſt him hath endamaged him.</p>
               <p>Thus if a man doe, God will accept him, and eſteeme of this as a ſufficient recompence, and will himſelfe rewarde the partie, and make vp his loſſe. And thus much for this eight commandement.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere ſhould haue followed the ſumme of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and the handling of inward ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and raſh iudging, and the two cauſes thereof vz. Fooliſhneſſe &amp; vncharitableneſſe; which notes the partie that tooke the former copie, as then came to ſhort to ſet downe, and ſince by no meanes could come by them. The third followes,</p>
               <p>The third cauſe of this vniuſt ſuſpicion &amp; miſdeeming is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conſcience; for when one is himſelfe infected with any ſin and lies in it without repentance, he is readie to meaſure all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by himſelfe, and thinkes no man can goe vpright, now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe halts, And this is exceeding plaine in <hi>Saule.</hi> He was a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked murtherer and purpoſed fully, if by any meanes he might effect his purpoſe to kill <hi>Dauid,</hi> and therefore we ſee howe he goes about craftily to bring him in danger, vnder a ſhew of friendſhip, and forſooth did beare ſuch a good minde to <hi>Dauid</hi> that worthie man and faithfull captaine, that had ventured his life for Gods cauſe and in the defence of his people; as that hee would freely and willingly admitte him to ſo neere a place as to be the Kings ſonne in law. And therefore if <hi>Dauid</hi> were as willing to accept of his offer in kindneſſe and dutie, as he was deſirous kindly to grant it, and offer it, there ſhould be no let but <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould without delay eſpouſe his daughter, and become his ſonne in law, therefore he willed all his ſeruants to commend his good will vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> and to ſhewe him howe highly he was in the Kings fauour; when all this while GOD knowes and hath made the world to know, that this was but to entrap him and bring him into a ſnare, that by her means he might the ſooner priuily diſpatch him. But when <hi>Dauid</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie was vnwilling to take ſo high a place and therefore excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe for his pouertie and inabilitie to giue a dowrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting the greatneſſe of ſuch a perſonage; <hi>Saule</hi> verie glad of ſo good an occaſion as he thought would not let it ſlip; but as he made ſhew, in great kindneſſe tels him; what is the dowry all that you ſtand vpon? if that be all the impediment, I will ſoone remoue this let, and the matter ſhall bee effected. Let
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29174:176"/> not <hi>Dauid</hi> thinke but that his nature will afford a dowrie good enoughe for a princes daughter, and let him not imagine that <hi>Saule</hi> is ſo farre in loue with mony as that he will looke for ſo great a ſumme of him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hopes to find a valiant &amp; coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſonne; no <hi>Dauid,</hi> thy valure is a treaſure and ſome of this courage, is that which my ſoule deſires, and which ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſh this mariage we deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let mee but ſee heere 100. foreskins of the Philiſtines, thoſe enemies of God, and Gods people by whoſe meanes we haue ſuſtained much loſſe and daunger. Doe then I ſay take reuenge of theſe my dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foes, which thy valure I know can doe without delay, and theſe ſhall be to me in ſtead of ſo many maſſes of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this ſhall be a price for which and in recompence whereof I will beſtow my daughter vpon thee, which I doe not aske, doubting of thy valure and courage, but that a further experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may more amply proue that of which we haue had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall tryall in thy ſelfe, that thou wilt be a valiant ſon vnto me This was a colourable ſpeach &amp; prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded great good will, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the meane while, all <hi>Sauls</hi> mind burned with malice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>Dauids</hi> death and he hoped by this meanes to make him fall by the hand of the Philiſtians. Now <hi>Saule</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne falſehood and double dealing, was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought into a vehement, but a moſt falſe and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuſpicion of <hi>Dauids</hi> infidelitie and treacherie towards him.</p>
               <p>So thoſe that haue poluted their owne ſoules and bodie with moſt filthy facts, and are the moſt vncleanneſt and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons in a countrie, will ſooneſt imagine and ſuſpect an other to be moſt filthie and are readie to iudge all men ſore where their ſores runnes. An other cauſe of this is hipocriſie when one neuer examineth his owne heart, then he is moſt readie to prie into an other mans life, and he that ſpares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will lay load vpon an other.</p>
               <p>Thus the Scribes and Phariſes were diſſembling hipocrites, and neuer medled with their owne hearts to condemne any ſinne there, and therefore Chriſt and his diſciples could haue
<pb facs="tcp:29174:177"/> no peace by them, but they were continually miſdeeming and ſuſpecting and ready to cenſure hardly of them without a cauſe, for if they would haue beſtowed but ſome time, in truth to haue entred vnto their owne ſoules, and made a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſearch of themſelues, they would haue founde ſo much buſineſſe there as other men might haue liued quietly enough by them. So Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, 3. <hi>Chap. 17. verſ. That true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is from aboue, is without iudging without hipocriſie.</hi> He ſhewes the cauſe why the beſt men be neuer the raſheſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, neuer ſo haſtie to paſſe ſentence vpon other men, becauſe they hauing true hearts &amp; deſiring to be as good as they ſeeme to be, haue ſo much to doe in fighting and ſtriuing with their owne corruptions, as that they cannot ſpend ſo much time, to be examining other mens dealings, and marking what other men doe amiſſe.</p>
               <p>So on the other ſide take me an hipocrite that cares for nothing but to make a ſhew before men, that neuer labours to approue his heart to God and neuer ſtriues againſt his owne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſinnes, you ſhall haue him ſo nimble and ſo quicke in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out other men that he cannot ſee a fault where it is, but he hath ſuch ſharpe ſight that hee can ſee a fault where none is in an other becauſe he cannot ſee a fault where it is in himſelfe. They thought that the cauſe why they could ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne other men, was becauſe they were more holy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other men, and therefore tooke a priuiledge to themſelues, to giue what verdit they thought good on euerie mans actions, but Saint Iames tels them an other tale and brings the true cauſe indeede, what made their hearts ſo readie to conceiue amiſſe and to thinke wrongfully of an other, becauſe they had not as yet learnd to thinke aright of themſelues, for more hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie alwaies breedes more raſh iudging and miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what be the cauſes of this euill ſuſpicion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the leſt fooliſhneſſe and vncharitableneſſe, or elſe an ill conſcience and deepe hipocriſie and the one of theſe is alwaies a cauſe. Now the effects are euen as bad, for if the heart bee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29174:177"/> infected thus it makes one apt and readie to ſpeake &amp; do euill, if one allow himſelfe to thinke euill, hee cannot withhold his tongue to ſpeake it, and his hand to practiſe ill if occaſion ſerue, for what euer is within in the thought that will ſhew it ſelfe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, it will bewray it ſelfe in the mouth, in the hand, in all ones actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. As appeares in <hi>Daniels</hi> enemies that hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an ill opinion of him, that he kept them from honour, did nothing elſe but practiſe and lay diuiliſh plots till they had brought him into danger of death and founde him within the compaſſe of a law. All this malice aroſe from hence, that they falſely ſuſpected <hi>Daniel</hi> to foreſtall them of honour and to haue kept them from that high place, that they thought themſelues as worthye of, and euery way as fitte for it as hee.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this is that if we would not be found culpable of the breach of this commandement, and trangreſſing againſt the name and fame of our chriſtian brother, then muſt we not giue ourſelues allowance to conceiue any ill opinion of them without ſufficient warrant, and due ground for the ſame, for though the thing which we ſuſpect be ſo indeede, that is not the queſtion, if we haue no warrant, nor noe good proofe and foundation for our ſuſpicion, we are guiltie of the hurting the fame of our neighbour, for what though it may he ſo, in matters of our neighbours credit, we muſt not take ſuch light coniectures as a ſufficient cauſe to moue a ſuſpicion; we muſt doe as we would be done by, and I pray you what man aliue almoſt is there that would not in his heart iudge this an vncharitable thing that becauſe his neighbour ſhould ſee I know not what weak probability, or rather ſurmiſes that had no probabilitie in them of ſome fault, therefore he ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke and conclude that it was euen ſo, and beare ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him as of a trangreſſor in that kind, what euer fault it be, and ſo giue his name ſuch a wound in his conſcience by this deeming as could hardly be healed againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man would count this good dealing to himſelfe and therefore euerie man muſt looke to himſelfe that he doe not build a ſuſpicion againſt
<pb facs="tcp:29174:178"/> his neighbour vpon weake and idle props, neuer thinke ill of one, till he hath deſerued and giuen ſufficient cauſe of it. But now this muſt be known by the way, that though loue wil not allow ſuſpicion, yet it doth not thruſt out diſcretion, it iudgeth not raſhly, but it iudgeth iuſtly, it is not ſo ſharpe ſighted as to ſee a little moath where none is, nor ſo purblind, but it can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a beame, therefore raſhneſſe muſt be condemned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded, but there is an holy wiſdome to be had, as not to miſdeeme without ſufficient warrant, ſo when there is euident proofe, and plaine appearance of a ſinne to take notice of it to, which muſt be obſerued againſt many men that by this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and indeede wreſting it as euill men doe all ſcripture, take occaſion to thruſt admonition out of dores, and thinke all men ſhould be blinde, becauſe God will haue all men charitable. For ſo when they haue broken forth openly into groſſe ſignes of wickedneſſe, and all their life ſhewes them to be prophane, vngodly, couetous, and deceitfull, and without the feare of God, come now and admoniſh that certainly they be wicked perſons and haue no true faith nor repentance, preſently you ſhall haue this firſt defence, Oh, GOD knowes myne heart you muſt not iudge, you muſt not ſcearch into a mans heart.</p>
               <p>But a chriſtian muſt iudge wiſely though not raſhly, he may iudge by the fruit, though not by the ſap; if ones wickedneſſe be hidden, then God would not haue men cenſure, but if it breake forth he would haue men take heede and reproue alſo. As for example if one ſee a man that delights in ill companie, is neuer wel and as he would be, but when he is among drunkards and ſwearers, and blaſphemers and ſuch like vermine, one may iuſtly and vpon good ground without any ſinne ſuſpect ſuch an one, and ſay, ſuerely, this man is a bad fellowe, ſuch as his mates are, ſuch is he, for ſurely good men would be glad of the ſocietie of good men, and lambs will reioyce to be with lambes, and now he that doth take all his pleaſure to be among vngodly perſons, he hath pronounced ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt himſelfe, like company, like man that keepes the companie. So if one
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29174:178"/> heare any vomite out filthie and vnchaſt ſpeeches, &amp; his tongue be full of vncleanneſſe, his mouth is neuer emptie of lewd and luſtfull words, now this is an infallible note and ſure brand of a filthie, vnchaſt, vncleane perſon, for out of the aboundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeakes; looke what ware comes into the ſhop, ſuch is ſurely kept in the warehouſe, and he that thinks thus of ſuch a perſon doth him no wrong at all.</p>
               <p>So others haue a good hope and a good faith, they hope to be ſaued as well as the beſt, if one will beleeue them, and if you will not beleeue them, they take as a great iniurie done to them. But what reaſon can they giue of their hope, what ſound cauſe can they alledge why they ſhould be ſaued rather then <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp; not goe to hell as well as <hi>Cayne,</hi> ſurely, for a reaſon they can yeeld no reaſon of their faith, they be not learned, but they haue a good heart, and a good hope, that God will ſaue them. Nay they neither haue good heart nor good hope, for a good hope is alwaies vpheld by good reaſons and a ſtrong faith, by ſtrong grounds out of Gods word, elſe a man may talke of hope and faith, and a good heart, and be farre enough from any, leaſt he can ſhew vpon what ground he builds his hope, it is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and when ſinne and death ſhall encounter ſuch an one, he ſhall fall away without any ſtrength at all. So for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it is common cuſtome of men, a day or two before they come to the communion, to wrap vp many reckonings and foule matters among themſelues, and to rake vp the coles of their malice vnder the aſhes, ſo cloſely, as that one would hope there were no ſparke left, to kindle contention againe. But a day or two after, they be as craftie, as brawling, as full of couſening; &amp; deceitfulneſſe as euer before then one may boldly ſay, you haue polluted the holy Sacrament, you haue defiled the table of the lord, you came to it without faith or repentance, oh but you muſt not iudge. Yes now the caſe is ſo cleare a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may iudge, for certainly if one come with repentance to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſhall go with repentance from the Sacrament, &amp; if one come a good man thether, it will make him better then he was; for God will alwaies keepe his promiſe, and if one come as he
<pb facs="tcp:29174:179"/> commaunds, he ſhall finde his ſinne killed, and he would not haue falne to his olde courſe ſo ſoone again, nor returned to his filthie vomit, if he had fed of the holy and pure bread of life <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> with an heart purged by faith and repentance. And therefore though no man muſt ſuſpect without good ground, yet a man where there is iuſt cauſe ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce iuſt iudgement. Thus much for the firſt which is the moſt ſecrete and inwarde breach of this commaundement.</p>
               <p>Now the outward followes, which is eyther without ſpeech or with ſpeech. Without ſpeech eyther by geſture or ſilence. By geſture, when one carries himſelfe reprochfully to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vſeth ſuch a kinde of behauiour as tends to vilifie mocke and diſgrace him. This Pſalme. 22. is condemned by a prophecie of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> That they nodded their heads at him and made mowes as indeed they did after, and this was as great an indignitie, and doth oft times as much diſgrace one, and make him contemptible in the eyes of the beholders, as if one ſhould rayle vpon him, with vilde and ſlaundrous words. This then is a wrong to ones name, though one doe not ſlaunder and rayle, yet if he vſe his hand or his tongue or heade or any part of his bodie in ſuch a cariage and geſture as doth tende to mocke his neighbour, he ſinnes againſt his name and credit. The next kind is by ſilence, when one houlds his peace when he heares his neighbour ſlaundred, he ſtands by and can teſtifie of his own knowledge that the thinges ſpoken be falſe and lying and yet either in flatterie or feare of diſpleaſing lets all alone, and doth not ſpeake that he knowes to defend his neighbours innocencie and credit, he comes within the compaſſe of bearing falſe witneſſe, and by ſilence makes himſelfe guilty of the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For he ſuffers his neighbours innocence to be ſuppreſſed and his name defamde when it lay in his power to defend him. And euen the law of nature will confute ſuch a man and ſtrike him downe dead that he ſhall haue nothing to ſay for himſelfe. For doth not nature teach vs that this is equall to doe as we would be done by?</p>
               <p>And which of vs is there that if one ſhould be in company
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29174:179"/> where he were charged with falſe accuſations &amp; that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour knew well enough but yet would not ſtirre his tongue to cleare him or ſhew the truth of the matter, and ſpeake in his neighbours defence, whom he knew to be farre from all ſuch ill practiſes; euery owne would that this ſilence were a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his neighbour, and a great wrong as indeede it were. Then if we thinke others ſhould not be ſilent when our name is wronged, let vs meaſure and open our mouthes to maintaine our neighbours puritie and good credit againſt any ſlaunderers, which if we doe, we ſhall keepe this commaundement, in ſome meaſure, and God will ſtirre vp others that in the like caſe ſhall defend vs, and ſpeake boldly to cleare our innocencie. And thus this commaundement is broken without ſpeach.</p>
               <p>Now by ſpeach it is broken either by giuing or receiuing. By giuing out ſpeach either true or falſe, for one may be an enemie and as much breake this commandement in ſpeaking nothing but the truth, in ſome caſes, as in other caſes if he ſpeake falſe and lying things, and this truth if it be put in the other end of the ballance of Gods iudgement will weigh as heauie as falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. If one ſpeake the truth without diſcretion, vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, out of time and out of place, if his words be true, but his end falſe and wicked, and his purpoſe naught, he is as cruell and malitious an enemie to the name and credit of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and as vilde a ſlaunder in the ſight of God, as if he ſpoke that which were falſe. This was the fault of <hi>Doeg,</hi> that curſed enemie of <hi>Dauid.</hi> When he ſees <hi>Saul</hi> haue an ill opinion of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all his freinds, and comes in a chafe to his men ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what will none of you tell me that my ſonne and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant haue conſpired againſt me? And <hi>Doeg</hi> knew full well by <hi>Sauls</hi> behauiour, that his end was miſchieuous, and he would make a diſpatch of all <hi>Dauids</hi> frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, he ſteps me out now in this vnſeaſonable time, and there ſhewes what he had ſeene; that the prieſt had giuen <hi>Dauid</hi> bread and a ſword, and counſelled with God for him. This was ſo indeed as he ſaid, but this was a moſt diuelliſh and wicked part, and a foule fault; for hence aroſe that cruell perſecution, and the murdering of ſo many innocent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:29174:180"/> of God. So in the enemies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they did indeede catch him as buſie at prayer as before, and it was true that he had broken the kings edict, but in the meane ſpace they were moſt wicked and vilde perſons that would bring this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>Daniel</hi> with ſuch a malitious purpoſe, and hence they bewrayed all their former malice in inuenting ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly decree, becauſe they knew <hi>Daniel</hi> could be caught in nothing but in matters of God and religion. And there he would not yeeld an inch to them, but ſooner leaue his life, then his God in the leaſt thing.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Ziphims Dauid</hi> had done them great good, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them againſt the Philiſtines, but now becauſe they ſaw this was only the way to carrie fauor in the court, to bring ſome tales concerning <hi>Dauid,</hi> therefore they come to <hi>Saul</hi> and tell him <hi>Dauid</hi> is in ſuch a place, this was no lie. But it was moſt ſlaunderouſly and wickedly done to blab out the truth to ſuch an ill end, and with ſo little diſcretion, when ſo ill a thing muſt needs inſue vpon it as at the leaſt the perſecution, if not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of an harmeleſſe man. So now a daies ſome men there be, that if they know any priuate fault, or particular and ſecret ſinne by any man, then without any regard of time and place, they proclaime their neihgbours infirmities to the wide world, &amp; care not before what company, among what perſons, they blaze out ones weakeneſſe, and then if they be reprooued, they exult and ſay, this is true I tell no lie, and I will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet a wiſe man would be aſhamed to ſpeak the truth fooliſhly and vnwiſely when it ſhould doe harme, and no good, and he would conſider that a man might often ſinne more in fooliſh and vntimely powring out theſe things that he knowes to be true, with an ill entent, then if through infirmity they ſhould ſpeake an vntruth with deſire and purpoſe to God. As the <hi>Ziphims</hi> and <hi>Doeg</hi> were greater breakers of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manndement, and more foule and ſhameleſſe lyars then <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> that told an vntruth to ſaue the ſpies, becauſe her end was good though ſhe fayled in the manner of it, but their ende was altogether naught and ſinfull.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:29174:180"/>
               <p>Thoſe then are heere to be confuted that will not doe as God commaunds them, tell their neighbour plainely of his fault, and not hate him in their hearts, but if they know a fault by him be farre enough of from telling him of it plainely vvhich vvere a dutie and an argument of loue: But ſtreight ſet him on the ſtage, make him knowne to all men, never leaue talking of it, which ſhewes plainly that in truth they hate their neighbor, for if they vvould as God bids, tell the partie, this vvould heale the ſoule, and couer his ſinne, and make him amend. But now to clamour in this wiſe, and raiſe vp an euill report and brute can doe no good but much miſchiefe. Oh but I ſpeake the truth: I but a foole ſpeakes all that he knowes, a wiſe man vvill keepe it in till afterward. Let a vviſe man heare of a thing, he vvill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the time and place, and perſons, and temper his ſpeech in vviſedome according to theſe circumſtances, but let a foole get a thing by the end once, and it muſt al out he cannot keepe it, he is with childe, and in paine till he be deliuered what euer diſhonour come to God, or diſcredit to his neighbour, or hurt to his owne ſoule. Therfore one muſt not onely be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he ſpeake no lying thing, but he muſt looke that hee ſpeake not the truth alſo to an ill end, after an ill manner when it may may doe more hurt then good. So much for that breach, now followes the next in ſpeaking that which is falſe, eyther concerning himſelfe or an other. Concerning himſelfe firſt in boaſting and bragging, which is a moſt baſe and abiect thing contrarie to that which the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Let an other praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth:</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. among the rabble of wicked men, men are reckoned boaſters, thoſe that becauſe there is no true matter of praiſes to be ſeene in them, will get praiſe by ſpeaking great things for themſelues. So <hi>Saule</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had ſaued the king, and all the beſt of the cattle, he comes bragging to <hi>Samuel,</hi> bleſſed be thou of the Lord ſaith hee, I haue fulfilled the word of the Lord, when it was nothing ſo, he had done nothing leſſe then fulfilled the word of the Lord. Heere he lyed now in bragging of himſelfe. And all in excuſing ones fault more then one ſhould. The thing wherein <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29174:181"/> ſinned in the ſame matter, for when his lie would not goe for currant, but <hi>Samuel</hi> caught him; why? haſt thou done the worke of God, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded? then all ſhould be dead, how comes it to paſſe then I heare bleating &amp; lowing? Make theſe two agree that all be dead, and yet I heare ſome bleat, vvhen this vvas a plaine caſe now, he had not done his dutie, then he ſhifts it thus; indeed, a few of the beſt of them vve haue kept for ſacrifice, but I hope that is no harme. But vvhen this vvould not ſerue the turne neither, but <hi>Samuel</hi> followes him cloſe, O ſaith he, hath God as much delight in ſacrifice as vvhen his vvord is obeyed? then he fals to an other excuſe, and caſtes it on the people. I feared the people ſaith hee, as vvho ſhould ſay it vvas their fault and none of mine, thus if any credit had beene to be gotten, he would haue had that to himſelfe alone, but now that no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit could be had, he leaues it for the people to deuide among themſelues. And this excuſing is a comon thing amongſt all men. Ye ſhall not haue the moſt ſimple perſon, the moſt ignorant and ſillie bodie in a vvhole towne, that hath the moſt ſhallow capacitie &amp; dull vvit that can be, but he is verie ſharpe and vvittie to finde an excuſe, he can ſcamble and vvinde, and vvill make hard ſhift to vvring his necke out of the collar, that hardly can any reproofe be faſtened vpon him. And men thinke by ſo doing to leſſen their fault, but in truth it is nothing ſo. For vvhat haue they gotten, but that now a man may ſay yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a lyar, that is ill accounted of both before God, and alſo before men, he vvas ill before, but now he is farre vvorſe.</p>
               <p>It is a verie ill thing vvhen one hath vvounded himſelfe by ſinne to goe to the diuell for a medicine, he is the vvorſt phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be, and his phiſicke is the vvorſt phiſicke in the vvorld, for he vvill ſure enough giue them that, that ſhall make them vvorſe and not better. One may thinke that theſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings be plaſters, but in truth they be but poyſons that venime the ſoule a great deale more then before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man lies againſt himſelfe by excuſing, as vvhen men in a kinde of proud humilitie vvill denie their gifts, vvith an intent to get more credit; oh alaſſe I haue no gifts, no vvit,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29174:181"/> no learning, a ſimple ſcholler and vveake memorie, and ſuch like, contrarie to that one knows &amp; thinkes; now this depreſing ones ſelfe falſely is not humilitie but iniquitie, for one ſhould make himſelf neither better nor worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath made him, but if he haue good calling to ſpeake of himſelfe plainly as the matter is in truth. And now if when they lye of themſelues, &amp; ſay they haue no wit, no learning, no good parts &amp;c. &amp; one ſaith why in truth it is true, you ſay well, it is right you haue none of all theſe things. Indeed they would thinke ſuch a man did them great wrong, &amp; ſcarce take him for their friend. For his deſire is that others ſhould croſſe him and ſay, nay ſay not ſo you are an excellent man worthie to be regarded &amp;c. and ſo he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelfe long enough, if he heare an other commend him, for this is it which he delights to heare.</p>
               <p>But a man muſt neither wrong God nor himſelfe in diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and concealing the things that God in goodneſſe hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, not to denie them, but to vſe them to his glorie. So for matters of this life, come to men for worke of mercie, and and then there is ſuch a whining, how poore they be, what a great charge they haue, what loſſes they haue ſuſtained, and I know not what, then they will needs be poore, whereas their owne ſoule beares them witneſſe that they are vvealthie, and haue much more then many men that doe a great deale more good then themſelues. Therefore, though a man doe not ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his neighbour, yet if he ſlaunder himſelfe he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued as a lyar. Heerein diuers of Gods children faile much in time of contemplation. Thoſe that haue beene, and are ſound and true hearted Chriſtians if they haue loſt their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a while, &amp; cannot finde that reioycing in God and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in good things that in former times they haue, then comes the accuſer of the brethren <hi>Satan</hi> that olde and ſubtile ſerpent, and he ſtriues to make them accuſe themſelues falſely. On ſaith he, if you had beene good indeed, and had had a true heart to God, he vvould neuer haue forſaken you thus, and giuen you ouer to ſuch a deadneſſe, and then through vveakneſſe, Gods children are readie to ioyne vvith the diuell againſt themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:29174:182"/> and to thinke; it is true, ſure I vvas but an hypocrite, and hollow hearted, my former comforts were but deluſions &amp; preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they had be beene true, I ſhould not haue loſt them. But this ought not to be, neuer yeeld to <hi>Satan,</hi> but if he ſtriue to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do you ſtriue to excuſe, &amp; if he would caſt you down, by ſo much the more lift vp your ſelfe by reaſons out of Gods word, and by former experience in your ſelfe &amp; other Chriſtians. For that is no good reaſon, becauſe you haue no feeling, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue no faith, and becauſe you haue loſt the ſence of your comfort, therefore it was no true comfort; this is no true concluſion, for thoſe whom God once loued, he loued to the end, and will neuer forſake them.</p>
               <p>Take heed of making ſuch concluſions, for a man may want the feeling of his faith, and crie and call againe and againe for it, and feele nothing all this while, yet neuertheleſſe haue true and ſound faith, if he feele not faith; but he feeles the want of faith, and the deſire of it, this is an infallible ſigne that he hath true faith. But doe not agree with the diuell to perſecute your ſelfe, fight againſt him not with him, againſt your ſelfe, you ſhall find he is ſtrong enough alone, you had not need ioyne with him, but rather ſet to reſiſt him: if one be once the child of God in truth he is ſo for euer, if once in the fauour of God, for euer in the fauour of God. If God loued once, he loues euer, for though our feeling alter, yet there is no chaunge in him. Thus much for breaking this commaundement, by ſpeaking that which is falſe concerning themſelues.</p>
               <p>Now it follows concerning others, and that is either publique or priuate. Publike firſt, when the magiſtrate or iudge pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeth a falſe ſentence in any cauſe that comes to be hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. This is a moſt heauie ſinne and is as much as in them is to make God a lyar, for he ſtands in the place and is his ſubſtitute and vicegerent here one earth; nowe then for him to beare men in hand that that iudgement which he giues is the iudgement of God that ſets him there, when yet hee knowes it is falſe and corrupt, this is euen to draw God to be the author of a lye, ſo much as he can. And this is not only a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29174:182"/> wrong againſt Gods owne Maieſtie, and the place wherein God hath ſet him, but it is an iniurie to the perſon thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, in that he brings a blotte vnto his name and makes him ill accounted of, and that wrongfully, and depriues him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commonly, of ſome commoditie and benefit that by right did pertaine vnto him. So for lawyers to ſpeake in an ill cauſe for their fee, though the cauſe be neuer ſo bad, yet let the fee be good, and you ſhall haue one or other likely will polliſh his tongue and whet his wit and ſharpen his face, to couer a foule matter with a many faire words, and make that good in vttering, which in doing was altogether wicked; this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly counted wit, and he a wiſe man that knowes howe to gloze thus and ſet a good face and good colours vpon a cauſe but it is in truth a lying and a publike ſlaunder, and that bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a curſe, for in <hi>Iſ. 5. The Lord ſaid curſed be he that ſpeakes good of euill, and euill of good.</hi> And ſo long as a man will ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtand for an euill thing, his conſcience will excuſe him of two foule breaches of Gods law, that he hath hindered iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and furthered vnrighteouſneſſe to the vtmoſt of his power.</p>
               <p>But here be ſome ſorry ſhifts. Alaſſe I ſpeake as I thinke I take the cauſe to be good, I muſt ſtand for my client. But I pray you what is the cauſe that you haue ſo ill eyes and ſuch a ſimple capacitie to perceiue the vniuſtneſſe of the cauſe that are ſo quicke witted to inuent clokes for the vniuſtice? Why cannot your witte ſee one as well as the other? How comes it about, that other men of farre leſſe skill in law, and wit by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after to or three of your bouts can ſoone ſee the double dealing &amp; how hollow matters are, and yet the faireſt ſide is put outward to? But you cannot fee, what is the cauſe of this blindneſſe, is it not becauſe the gift blinds the eyes of the wiſe, is not that which wanted in the goodneſſe of the cauſe ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greatneſſe of the fee and that is the cauſe you cannot ſee? But ſuppoſe this were true, and grant that you were as you ſay ignorant of the matter, is it not a foule ſhame to be ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous to ſpeake ſo much in a matter before you know whether
<pb facs="tcp:29174:183"/> it be good or not to come in the face of the world, and pawne your credit for a cauſe that you neuer tried nor examined nor ſearcht into it, to ſee whether it were right or wrong. <hi>Iob</hi> would not doe ſo, but thoſe cauſes that he knew he would enquire and ſearch out the matter, and not open his mouth to ſpeake, before he had prepared what and vpon what good ground to ſpeake in the defence of anyone. This will not ſerue the turne, when one hath abuſed his place, and abuſed his hearers, and abuſed himſelfe by maintaining wickedneſſe, to ſay alas I knew it not, it is fooliſh and ſhamefull this for owne to venture and hazard his ſoule and his name, and then beare himſelf in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that this will ſalue all becauſe he knew it not, as if ignorance vvere a plaſter good enough to heale the vvounds he hath made in his conſcience and credit. But why had not hee knovvne that it vvas a ſin to be ignorant, vviſe men ſhould vvorke by knovvledge. It is a moſt notorious fault vvhen one vvillingly and vvittingly ſtands in defence of an euill cauſe but is a fault to raſhly, and vnaduiſedly to ſlip into it. Further alſo falſe vvitneſſes doe publikely offende againſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement as in <hi>niſi prius,</hi> and ſuch like caſes; When one vvill come before the Iudges and giue a falſe and lying te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie.</p>
               <p>This is often ſpoken againſt in the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> a falſe vvitnes ſhall not eſcape; theſe be moſt peſtilent and hurtfull vipers &amp; theſe ſting and doe miſcheefe on euerie ſide, theſe peruert the iurers, delude the iudge, doe vvrong to the cauſe, and are hurtfull on euery ſide, put all out of order and turne all vpſide downe, by their falſhoode; this therefore ſhalbe firſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the puniſhment, becauſe they haue beene firſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the ſin.</p>
               <p>And this God abhorres vvhen men be ſo audatious and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, as publikely to ſin againſt God, and to choſe rather to pleaſe men in ſinning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſe God in a good cauſe. When the falſe loue or feare of man ſhall doe more with them to make them ſin, then the feare and loue of God can preuaile to keepe them from ſinning. All theſe doe publikely offende. Nowe
<pb facs="tcp:29174:183"/> priuate offence falſe and that is either in vniuſt accuſing or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt defending, That vniuſt accuſing priuatly is called ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and backebiting, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one vvil ſpeake euill of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that is free from that euill. This backebiting is a greate breach of this commandement and the backbiter offends in an high degree.</p>
               <p>And the fault is ſo much the vvorſe becauſe it alwaies hurts three at once, this blow alwaies makes three vvounds at one time, he wounds the ſoule of him to whom he tels the falſe tale, for as we ſhall heare after, the receiuer is in a great fault therefore he hath one deadly blow. The ſecond ſtroake lights on the name and reputation of the partie thus ſlandered &amp; backebitten, for his name hath a ſcarre in the account of the hearer. The laſt and worſt and greateſt blowe hee giues his owne ſoule vvhen he infects it vvith ſlaunder, and makes his conſcience guiltie of a lie. Theſe three mortall vvoundes this lying tongue like a percing ſword makes at one time. Indeede he ſcapes beſt who is falſely ſlaundered for he being innocent God will heale his name and bring forth his, but the other two wounds are more daungerous becauſe they light vpon the ſoule, and more harde to bee cured becauſe they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſtands euery man vpon, that he raiſe vp no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt report againſt any man. Now the beſt way to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt ſlaundering, is to make a couenant with his owne foule and to vow in himſele not to ſpeake often of others me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faults, for he that giues his tonge liberty to be buſied about this ſubiect, it cannot be auoyded but that he ſhall ſlip to farre and ſpeake worſe then in chriſtianitie and equitie he ſhould; he that will ſpeake to often of other mens infirmities, cannot keepe himſelfe from ſpeaking to much ſometimes, therefore the beſt vvay is to be ſparing in this kind of talke. Speake ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome firſt. Then ſecondly, when one hath a good calling &amp; iuſt cauſe to ſpeake, let him ſpeake diſcreetly in due time and due place, that ſome good may come by his ſpeach that either the partie may be brought to the ſight and amendment of his
<pb facs="tcp:29174:184"/> fault, or elſe others may be edified, and helped againſt ſuch faults, ſpeake in good affection, and with good diſcretion, that ſome or other may be the better for it. Euer more if one will ſpeake of an others faults, let him be able to ſay I ſpeake it to this, and this good end, this and this good vſe I hope will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of my ſpeach, or if he can ſee no profit that will come by his vttering it, let him keepe it till an other time, let him lay his hand vpon his mouth and ſay he hath gone farre enough all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.</p>
               <p>For if there can be no good vſe ſeene in ſpeaking of it, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there is much ſin in ſpeaking of it. And for rayſing of an ill and falſe report againſt ones neighbour, it appeares what a fault it is in that God hath appointed and decreed in his law, that thoſe which doe ſlaunder an other ſhall themſelues vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the puniſhment which ſuch a fault had deſerued, and ſuch a perſon haue ſuffered if the thing had beene true, as he that wrongefully accuſeth an other of theft, he himſelfe ſhould be dealt withall, as with a theefe, and he that reports that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath committed adulterie, if it be proued falſe, himſelfe muſt feele the ſmart that an adulterer ſhould. This the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God hath ordained, for what can be more iuſt, then that he which digs a pit for his neighbour without a cauſe, ſhould himſelfe fall into the pit, and he that ſeekes to take away his neighbours fame and life by a lye, ſhould looſe his owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and life for a lye. And this though the Magiſtrate neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his dutie, God will not neglect, but as he made the law ſo he will ſee it put in execution, (for he is not vniuſt) vnleſſe one firſt puniſh himſelfe by true repentance.</p>
               <p>Thus this law is broken by vniuſt accuſing. It is next bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by vniuſt defending of wicked men and bad cauſes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one will vſe his name and credit and prayſe to vpholde ſuch a man, whoſe name ſoule and bodie and all are worthie to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell. This is condemned 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. Where ſpeaking of this kind of men that be lyars in requeſt and falſe witneſſes in fauour, that be of ſo good a nature as that they will heale all thinges, make vp all gaps and make a gloſſe for any matter, they will
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29174:184"/> condemne no man, nor finde fault with nothing, of ſuch he ſaith, he that <hi>Iuſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the iuſt men, they both are abomination vnto God.</hi> He ſhewes that this dealing which men call a good nature is euen as abominable to God as if they ſhould condemne goodneſſe and good men. And therefore ſuch men get but a little, they carrie away the credit with men, but they are as much out of credit with God, as they with credit with man; and God will bringe about that they ſhall haue a ſpot in themſelues of that wickednes which they allow in an other, for at length God cauſes both the ſinne and the ſhame to breake out, and then their former honour is all daſht.</p>
               <p>So he ſaith in an other place, he that prayſeth the wicked the people will curſe him. To that he makes ſuch a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for himſelfe as both God and the people of God hate him and abhorre him. And in truth iuſtly to, for he is worthie to be hated becauſe he keepes men from repentance; for there is no better medicine in the world to heale the ſoule, and kill the ſinne, then to let the ſinner ſuſtaine the ſhame and the paine that is due for his ſinne, for this is a medicine of Gods making. And if all the phiſitians in the world lay their heads together they cannot inuent a better, and therefore if they had any true loue they would let them haue it, and not dawbe ouer the ſore ſo as it ſhould feſter &amp; ranckle to death. So that no greater enemie can be found to the ſoules of men, then ſuch that will ſmoth all thinges ouer with colourable ſhifts. Then alſo they doe much hurt to others, for now when ſinners are gotten in credit, &amp; crept into ſome account they are leſſe ſuſpected &amp; can with more eaſe doe hurt and miſcheefe; for if darkeneſſe might be called darkeneſſe, and ſinne goe vnder the name of ſin and the diuell come in his owne colours, it would be ſo open that no man would truſt, and ſo odious that all men would hate it. But now when the diuell will call euill good and come like an Angell of light, then men giue him ſome entertainment and he doth hurt them before they ſuſpect him, and when euill men be garniſhed with ſome falſe commendations, they can cloſely
<pb facs="tcp:29174:185"/> conuay their wicked intents to doe more hurt a great deale, becauſe they are leſſe doubted. As in one example may appeare in vngodly and ſufficient miniſters, if they can get ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to commend them, and ſome great mans letter to ſpeake for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that els would neuer haue come to ſo much credit are admitted without any further inquirie and to the place and office of the miniſtrie, and when by lying they haue entred, their whole dealing is agreeable to ſuch a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and they proue very wolues that ſterue and deuoure the Lords flocke.</p>
               <p>And all this miſcheefe came from a falſe witneſſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them with a lie. And ſo for matters of commonwealth when places of charge and importance are through falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, committed to naughtie and wicked perſons, oft theſe proue vilde &amp; wicked, doing much hurt in the place, ſo that theſe faulſe and fooliſh prayſes are but to get ſome credit to the wolfe that he may the more freely deuoure and waſt the flocke. So that as one muſt not ſpeake of his neighbors faults, but in loue and diſcretion and vpon good proofe, ſo neither muſt he ſpeake in his commendations. But in wiſdome, and when the commendation is grounded on knowledg and iudgment. And thus much for giuing out falſe ſpeaches.</p>
               <p>Now followes for receiuing; which is a fault no leſſe hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous before God then the former, for he is not only in fault that inuents lyes of his owne head but he alſo that receiues them and giues credit to them, and is bold to ground his report to an other vpon them. And that both concerning others and alſo concerning himſefe. To giue eare to a falſe report concerning an other is forbidden, as bewraying of a great want of loue, and good affection to the name of ones brother, and an ill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo in himſelfe, for <hi>Prouerbs.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>The wicked giueth heede to falſe lips and a lyar hearkens to the naughtie tongue.</hi> Here the holy Ghoſt noteth a tale-receiuer with two wofull brands, he cals him a wicked perſon and a lyar to, that is glad to here falſe tales of other men, he is a naughtie perſon himſelfe, and he him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe hath a falſe and a lying heart, for if he had not, hee would
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29174:185"/> neuer intertaine and approue and hearken vnto lies; and in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 15. The holy Ghoſt ſets down this as a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt an hipocrite that is hollow-hearted, and a true and ſounde ſaint of God; that an vpright man will not receiue a falſe report of his neighbour. Many bad men that haue no goodnes in them will not for their owne credit ſake, and to ſaue their honeſtie as we ſay, inuent ſlaunders and be the firſt makers and brochers of lyes. But if ſome vilde and impudent perſon will but come &amp; buzze in their eares ſome odde tale againſt profeſſors, they will ſtreight imbrace it, it goes for a warrant, tell it as confidently as if nothing could be more ſure, and are as glad of it, as if it were ſome verie gainefull and profitable thing vnto them; this man now though he will carrie the name of honeſt man, is a wicked perſon, and if the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes true a lyer. So in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. he ſaith, <hi>that without are all thoſe that make and loues lies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There he notes two kinds of lyars that muſt both goe to hell. There be two broods &amp; as it were two litters of theſe mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous lyars. Some be ſo ſhamleſſe and ſo graceleſſe and ſo impudent and the diuell hath taken ſo farre poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their hearts, as they delight to be coyning lies and buſie their heads in inuenting and beginning ſlaunders. Others be not ſo rude and ſo groſſe as that they will be the authors of a lye, but if an other man will bring it to them, they will not ſtande, to entertaine it, and approue it, It ſhall haue there good wordes and liking.</p>
               <p>So the Phariſes and high prieſts, would not themſelues come before <hi>Pilate</hi> and forſweare themſelues and beare falſe witneſſe againſt our Sauiour, their faces were not ſo hardned yet they had not ſo farre caſt of all feare of men and regard of their owne eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if they could meet with on that had ſo bold a face &amp; ſo wicked a mind, if they could get him for loue or monie, by hiring and intreating, or flattering, they were very well content and reioyced, they had found men ſo fit for their purpoſe, that would father a lye in the face of the world, and they be abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it to. So <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ieſabel</hi> would not ſo much debaſe
<pb facs="tcp:29174:186"/> themſelues, as to ſweare falſely againſt <hi>Naboth;</hi> but if they could get any lewd fellows, that would become periurd for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they would not refuſe the offer, but tooke the aduantage againſt <hi>Naboth</hi> to put him to death. This ſerues to confute ſuch as haue open eares, and will let in any lie that comes from the tale bearers mouth and giue it harbour to, and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſerue, ſette it forth againe, and rehearſe it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon ſo bare a proofe, making noe other triall of it.</p>
               <p>But come to them and tell them of it, why would you ſpeake ſo falſe a thinge to dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame your brother, this is the anſwere preſently; why, I did not bring it vp, I am not the firſt that ſpoake it, I hearde it, twas tolde me, and I had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, and I thought it to be true. Did you heare it, &amp; did you beleeue it vpon the bare hearing, then you ſhewe what you are, ſuch an one of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>A foole beleeueth euerie thing.</hi> Firſt, euerie ill thing, for ſo it muſt be vnderſtood elſe of all men they are moſt hard of beleefe. Tell him of that will doe him good, that will ſaue his ſoule, and helpe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſinne, he will not beleeue it, one muſt keepe ſuch a ſtirre in perſwading, and bring reaſon vpon reaſon, and neuer the neere, you can by no meanes perſwade him, but bring fooliſh ware to a foole ſuch as hurts his owne ſoule and his brothers name, and diſhonours God, and makes himſelfe a lyar this is fit for him, this bargaine is made without many words, he is verie eaſily brought to credit ſuch matters, and why? becauſe he is a wicked foole, lyes are a bait for a foole, and laye theſe in his way and hee is taken without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>For as the ſpirit of God is a ſpirit of truth, and thoſe that haue it, it leads them into all truth, and they are eaſily brought to giue eare to the truth, ſo the diuell is a lying ſpirit, he is the father of lies, &amp; thoſe that he poſſeſſeth he will make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue euerie lye.</p>
               <p>And therefore this excuſe will not hold out, I was tolde ſo and how can I tell but it is true, it may be it is ſo, and it may be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29174:186"/> it is not ſo, if the ground of your beliefe be no ſtronger, it is a fooliſh beleefe.</p>
               <p>Verie nature will conuince ſuch perſons of want of charitie; for would any man be content, that an other ſhould take euery flying report, and vncertaine rumor that went about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, concerning him, and giue credit to it, and ſuch credit as he would thinke ill, and ſpeake ill of him vpon this alone founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? would one thinke he had wrong, you ſhould haue tried out the matter before you had beene caried away with it, you ſhould haue ſearched whether it were ſo or no, talked and conferd with thoſe that could tell you the certaintie of it afore you had ſo farre truſted it, as to rehearſe it, and report it your ſelfe. Why? is an other bound to deale ſo with you, and is it not your dutie to doe ſo to others? Muſt not we doe as we would be done by, and haue that care of an others name and credit, that we deſire an other ſhould haue of ours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is plainely iniurious and wrongfull dealing, and thoſe that haue this way falne, muſt repent for it, and aske pardon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne, to driue away ſuch as be ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of other mens dealings ſuch tale-tellers, as the holy ghoſt ſpeaked. <hi>As the North winde driues away raine, ſo doth an angrie countenance a ſlaundering tongue.</hi> When the aire is thick &amp; the clouds looke blacke, and there is a ſhew as if they fill the countrie with raine, the North winde it riſeth and purgeth the ayre makes the coaſt cleere, and diſpels the clouds, and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth; ſo muſt a wiſe man beare ſuch grauitie in his face, as that he may blow away flattring ſlanderers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come full fraught with lies, he muſt diſpell them by his verie lookes, and not ſuffer them to vnload their naughtie and lying ſtuffe in his eares. Therefore if the maſter perceiue any of his ſeruants to delight in ſecret telling tales in whiſpering againſt others, and bringing newes to traduce his neighbour, that they may get more credit vnto themſelues, he muſt looke frowningly vpon ſuch clawbackes, and driue them from him, giue them no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, nor ſhew them no iot of allowance, when they will be
<pb facs="tcp:29174:187"/> readie to bring ſuch light ſtuffe to ones eares, as they dare to and affirme.</p>
               <p>This is a foule fault in him that cannot occupie himſelfe in any beter buſineſſe then traducing his neighbours, and it is as naught in the receiuer, when he receiues them with kinde lookes, and giues them ſome countenance, and maintains them in this wicked courſe, it is the part of a foole to beleeue euerie thing, one muſt not be ſo light of credit. Indeed in matters pertayning to our good that God hath ſet downe in his word, the quicklier, and the eaſier one can beleeue them, the better it is, but for theſe idle tales, that tend to nothing but to breed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable conceits againſt our brethren, let them haue no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment, vnleſſe they come garded with ſound and good reaſons, and proofes, for we ſay of theft, the receiuer makes the theefe, ſo is it in lying to, the receiuer makes the lyar, for if the lyars could haue no vtterance of his ware, &amp; no man would deale with him in ſuch trafficke, but ſhake him vp with a ſharpe reproofe, he would ſoone be a wearie of his trade, but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ware goes away ſo faſt, and he can haue good ſale for them, he is in verie good liking with his olde occupation, and falls to coyning againe. Thus this commaundement is broken in receiuing lyes concerning an other.</p>
               <p>It is broken alſo when one receiues lies concerning himſelfe. whether in flatterie, or accuſing. For receiuing and embracing the fawning flatterie of others. This was <hi>Herods</hi> fault. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. The fooliſh people, hearing his eloquent oration, and ſeeing his pompe and glory, would needs make a God of him, and they giue him an applauſe, the voyce of God and not of man: now he ſits downe by it, and was very well content it ſhould be ſo ſpoken. It was a baſe &amp; abiect thing for them to go ſo farre in flattering, &amp; it was as great a madnes in him to take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and be glad of it. They plaied the fooles too much in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch a falſe and blaſphemous applauſe, and he plaide the foole farre more in receiuing it. So for <hi>Felix</hi> the gouernour, comes <hi>Tertullus,</hi> and becauſe he would currie fauour with him, and haue him ſerue his turne, he reckons vp vertues good ſtore,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29174:187"/> and will ſet him vp high enough; ſaith hee: <hi>Seeing that we haue obtained great quietneſſe through thee, and that many worthy things are done vnto this nation through thy prouidence we acknowledge it moſt noble Felix with all thanks.</hi> And thus he ſets in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in the beginning to winne him to ſerue his owne turne. This was a ſeruile and contemptible thing for him to lie thus openly, for it was well knowne, and he was not ignorant, that <hi>Felix</hi> was a moſt cruell, vniuſt, and filthie perſon. Now <hi>Felix</hi> ſits by, is guiltie in his conſcience, that he had been a verie wolfe, and a tyrant, and an vngodly perſon, knowes all this is falſe therefore, yet the fooliſh man ſwallowes all, and was very willing to heare a long catalogue of falſe praiſes. In this doing now he ſinned grieuouſly. Therefore a man muſt be content with that praiſe which Gods word and his owne works doe giue, and neither ſeeke for nor receiue any more. That which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith of a vertuous woman, euerie man muſt obſeru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of himſelfe, <hi>Let her works praiſe her,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon. Prouerbs.</hi> 31. 31. So muſt euerie man be content with that praiſe that he deſerueth, &amp; not ſo much looke what other men ſpeak, as what himſelfe hath done.</p>
               <p>Therefore this condemnes the fooliſhneſſe of thoſe, that will bring vp flatterers, and keepe companie with ſuch ſlauiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as will be alwaies giuing them falſe and vndeſerued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, &amp; that before their face to: And then let ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon come &amp; fawne vpon him, and caſt forth a many lies, Oh you deale wiſely, you take a good courſe, you play the good husband, and you prouide for your ſelfe. Then let Gods miniſters reproue them as long as they will, and their faithfull friends admoniſh them, they beare of all with this, and they will follow their owne waies, and why ſo? you reprehend me, and found fault, but I cannot ſee it is ſuch a fault as you ſpeake of, for I know there be that commend you, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſycophants, and diſſembling clawbackes, that will ſpeake any thing for aduantage, and any thing is good, if they hope to get by it. And why will you be ſo fooliſh to beleeue thoſe that ſpeake for your hurt, in that thing that your conſcience
<pb facs="tcp:29174:188"/> eyther doth knowe, or may knowe to be altogether falſe. This is that which hardens the heart, this keepes from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, this makes one obſtinate, that he will goe on, and nothing ſhall turne him, when he harkens to ſuch as will ſooth him vp in any thing, care not what they ſpeake, ſo they may pleaſe, and ſo ſuffers himſelfe rather to be deceiued and ſeduced by them then admoniſhed and led in the right way by God.</p>
               <p>And this ſhewes a uerie ignorant and fooliſh minde, that one is not acquainted with his owne eſtate, nor doth not caſt ouer his accounts that hang betwixt God and himſelfe. For if ſome fooliſh fellow to ſome banquerupt that knewe the particlars, and had often reckoned ouer his debts, and ſaw plainely that he owed more then hee was worth, if ſome companion as beggarly as himſelfe woulde come and tell him, you are a verie rich man, you haue great wealth, you are able to buy lands, and purchaſe fayre lordſhips, and ſuch other idle talke, would he be perſwaded by him, woulde he leaue this, and bragge of his wealth, and take himſelfe for ſome great perſonage? it were impoſſible, hee woulde count him for a madde man that would ſay thus, but hee would be neuer a whit the prouder for all his tales. So if a man would often rifle his conſcience, goe ouer his affections, and ſee how they be diſordered, conſider his actions, how farre ſquare from Gods law they be, and thus vſe to ſee into himſelfe, and make account of his debtes, and arrerages, wherein he had caſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Then let a thouſand ſmothtongud diſſemblers come and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, you haue liued honeſtly, you haue behaued your ſelf well and like a chriſtian you are a verie vertuous man; all of them could not driue it into his heart, he would neuer receiue their falſe teſtimonie, but would ſay, no, I ſee how much and how often I faile in my dutie, how much, I how often I runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into ſinne againſt Gods commandements, I know my ſelfe, it is nothing ſo, and then he would quiukly diſcouer their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and perceiue their treacherie. But now becauſe men be ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29174:188"/> careleſſe that they will not caſt ouer their their owne account themſelues, and make a right reckoning that they might know their owne eſtate, therefore others come and bring in falſe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings, and make falſe accounts, and ſo they be deceiued, and thinke themſelues in a verie good plight, when in truth they are moſt wicked and miſerable. Therefore a man muſt not take any more praiſe or commendation, then that he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue to be true by the teſtimonie of Gods word, and the witneſſe of his owne works and life, beware of that, that puffes vp, and hardens, let no man perſwade vs that we be better, or our ſinnes leſſe then they be. And thus much for receiuing of thoſe falſe teſtimonies concerning ones ſelfe that they come in the way of praiſe, and extolling. Now for thoſe that come in the way of accuſing and depreſſing.</p>
               <p>For as one muſt not yeeld to the flatteries of other, ſo neither muſt he yeeld to their falſe accuſations concerning himſelfe, that tend to make him thinke worſe of himſelfe then indeed he ought, and ſo to diſable him to doe that good he ſhould, and alſo hath libertie to doe. So <hi>Iob</hi> would not accord to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his friends in this caſe, let them ſay as oft as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he was an hypocrite, and had not an vpright heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Iob</hi> would not for all that conſent that it was ſo, he would not while he liued forſake his innocencie, and let let goe the puritie of his cauſe, nor would thinke a whit the worſe of his former life or of his preſent eſtate for all their proofes and reaſons that they did falſely alledge againſt him, for he knew that he had many daies and times before, made all euen betwixt God and himſelfe, he had many a time caſt ouer his accounts, and found himſelfe acquitted of all before God, that no debt remained to be laid to his charge. For howſoeuer no manwhiles his life endures ſhall be freed from the dregs of ſinne, and the ſpots of corruption, yet when he in a ſight of his faults, comes to repent, and be ſorrie for them, and to pray to God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them, and to beleeue that God for Chriſts ſake will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, he is as free then from the guilt and puniſhment of all his ſinnes, as if he had beene euer from the action of them,</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29174:189"/>
               <p>Now <hi>Iob</hi> knew that he had often after this ſort ſet all recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings right betwixt God and himſelfe, and that no fault hung vpon the ſcore vnrepented and vnforgiuen. Therefore all their perſwaſions could not withdraw him from his faith, and from clearing himſelfe of hypocriſie, for what euer they ſaid, his own works which he had in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, God &amp; his own conſcience with which he was well acquainted ſaid, that he was true ſincere vpright, and guiltleſſe of that crime which they ſo ſharply char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him. Wherefore he ſet them all at defiance that would offer to make challenge to his innocencie. Though his wealth was gone, his children dead, his cattell ſtolne and kild, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſlaine, and his friends all gone backe from him, yet his innocencie ſtucke to him, and his aſſurance that he ſerued God in the truth of his heart, and the vprightneſſe of his ſoule abode by him and this neither his friends nor foes, nor all the diuels in hell could wreſt from him, but he held it faſt in ſpite of them all, and that was the cauſe he bore his affliction ſo patiently, and with ſo great comfort. But now if he had embraced this falſe teſtimonie and accuſation euen of good men, and ſaid alaſſe, indeed this is true that you ſay, I neuer had an vpright heart to God, I did all in hypocriſy &amp; al in diſſembling, nothing in ſynceritie, nothing in truth, it is euen ſo, I am, I am an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, he might and could not choſe, but haue held downe his head with ſhame, and he had beene wholy oppreſt with griefe and vexation, all his good actions, would haue afforded him no iot of comfort, no conſolation or peace, for if they had been done in hypocriſie, they had beene all ſinnes, and he would haue had no heart, nor could not haue endured to come to God, nor lift vp any prayer to him, for ſo he ſaith, can the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite pray to God at all times? and thus hauing depriued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, of theſe ſtayes and ſupportes, he muſt needs haue ſunke downe in deſpaire and anguiſh.</p>
               <p>This ſerues to confute thoſe that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they be in truth ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Chriſtians, and many infallible works of true Chriſtianitie haue appeared, and doe now appeare in them, yet if the diuell eyther doe himſelfe or elſe moue ſome wicked, ſome filthie ſinner to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29174:189"/> roare in their eares that they be hypocrites, and that they haue no truth in them, do all in diſſembling, and to be ſeene of men; ſtreight way they are readie to ioyne hands with <hi>Satan,</hi> and vſe their owne ſtrength againſt their owne ſoule, and will ſeeke out reaſons to confirme the diuels falſe and ſlaunderous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but in truth to weaken their owne faith, and bring much needleſſe trouble, and many gripes vpon their ſoule, that if they had withſtood theſe lies, they might haue eſcaped. Nay (ſay ye) ſurely it is as they ſay, wretch that I am, God hath met with me now, they ſhould not haue had power to ſay ſo, had it not been ſo, I am falſe all that I haue done is in vaine, it was but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſſembling.</p>
               <p>And why ſo? Is not the diuell a lyar, and will you ſo eaſily giue him credit, and that at the firſt? But this is not well, for as one ſhould not yeeld to the vniuſt and falſe praiſes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo neither muſt he condemne himſelfe, vpon ſo ſlender a ground as the diuels or diuelliſh mens words: nay one muſt not ſo eaſily rob God of his praiſe, and himſelfe of his comfort. And as the former perſons, were ſo eaſily ſeduced in matter of their comendation, becauſe they ſeldome or neuer looke ouer their ſins, ſo theſe are ſo quickly put in doubt of their vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe they doe not vſe to marke what good workes they doe, and to conſider what graces God hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For if one would not be alwaies looking into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and ſearching into their infirmities, but ſometimes lift vp their eyes to the mercies of God, to that ſtrength which he hath giuen them againſt ſinne, and power to doe ſome good things, and make as diligent a rehearſall of Gods benefits, as of their afflictions and miſeries, they would not be ſo eaſily driuen from their hope, and put out of comfort. The diuels ſlaunders would not daunt them ſo much, but they would take faſter hold of Gods mercie. Thus much, for the breach of this commaundement.</p>

               <p>Firſt, for the inward dutie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heere euerie man is bound to haue a charitable opinion, and good conceit of his neighbour, with a deſire of his good name and credit. This louing perſwaſion of the heart, is contrarie to the former inſtructing and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming. For as ſuſpition allowed makes one lye open to all the ſinnes that follow in ſpeaking or receiuing ill reports, ſo this being obſerued that our hearts be well ſeaſoned with this charitable opinion and deſire of his credit, one is ſure not to ſlaunder himſelfe, and he can nothing ſo eaſily be tainted by receiuing the venim of falſe ſlanders from other mens mouths. Therefore to mound our ſelues againſt all other breaches of this commaundment, Firſt, get our hearts to giue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29174:190"/> that good allowance, that wiſdome and charitie will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde him. Now whether one haue this maine and principall vertue of this commandement or no, It muſt be tried, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may know his owne heart by theſe three rules. Firſt, in doubtfull thinges where the matter is not plaine, alwaies take thinges in the beſt part if any ſence can be found better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let that be had, If matters be not to euidently ill, alwaies a heart that is charitable diſpoſed to his neighbours credit, will ſeeke the beſt interpretation and as neere as hee can make the beſt of euery thing.</p>
               <p>But if one conſtrue thinges in the worſt ſence and wreſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing to ſome ill meaning or intent, this man ſhewes planely that malice lurkes in his hart, and that he neither deſires the eſtimation of his neighbour, nor wiſheth any good thought and perſwaſion of him in his heart. Therefore <hi>Paule. Rom.</hi> 1. Sets this downe in the midſt of many other groſſe ſins, <hi>that take all things in the worſe part,</hi> becauſe this is a plaine proofe and teſtimonie that the heart is poyſoned with the gall of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and that there is a malicious and ſlaundrous mind. Let this be the firſt triall then, conſtrue things that be vncertaine and will beare two conſtructions, after the moſt fauourable manner one can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a louing heart and a good affection to an other mans credit will ſhewe it ſelfe in the tongue by defending him and taking his part if wee heare any ſlaunders ſpoken againſt. For ſilence is a betraying his innocencie, and therefore if an other in hatred will ſhew his malice by ſpeaking lies in his diſgrace, then we muſt in loue open our mouth and ſhewe our good will by relating the truth in his defence. Thus <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> knowing <hi>Dauid</hi> to be a vertuous man &amp; worthy, and that all thoſe thinges were altogether falſe that <hi>Saule</hi> imagined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; But that the King was miſinformed and miſlead by pickethanke ſlaunderers. Though it was to his father and that as he had ſeene with daunger of his life, he will not holde his tongue but diſcharge a good conſcience and declare the innocencie of an innocent againſt whoſoeuer would come to
<pb facs="tcp:29174:191"/> ſlaunder him. Therefore this ſerues to confute thoſe that will beare one in hand that they beare a very good minde &amp; a great good will to profeſſours and to chriſtians that be the ſeruants of God. But you ſhall neuer heare a worde come from them to defend them, if they be in place where they may be rayled on and vniuſtly ſlaundred. They thinke they haue quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues if they can ſay ſay thus. I haue beene in ſuch a place and there were ſuch a companie of vilde and wicked perſons that rayled at profeſſours and vilified them with all the indignitie they could, and ſpared not to ſpeake moſt intollerable lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch and ſuch honeſt men. And what did you all this while? why ſurely, I was ſorry but I could not helpe it, I did not ioyne with them but I euen held my tongue, and let them goe on and ſpake neuer a word. Did you ſay nothing you may ſay that with ſhame enough, what did you there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But there were more noble and more learned, and men that had more authoritie there then I at the ſame time, and what reaſon had I to ſpeake before them, they ſhould haue ſpoken in the defence of thoſe that were abuſed. Should they and did they not? And why did not you then? Suppoſe your ſelfe had beene the partie ſlaundred, what would you then haue done? What? why I had good reaſon to ſpeake in mine owne cauſe &amp; to ſtand for my ſelfe, had I not? who would ſtand by as though he were tongue tied, and heare his credit troden vnto foote and ſpeake neuer a word in his owne defence? he were a beaſt that would doe it. And haue you ſo quickly forgotten that rule and principall of nature to loue your neighbour as your ſelfe, to doe to him as you would be done by? Could you haue found words to haue ſpoken for your ſelfe, and are dumbe for an other, where is your loue, where your goodwill, what mind now beare you to his good name? Here now one muſt needes confeſſe in his heart that he wanted that good affection to his neighbours reputation that he ſhould haue had, for if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of our neighbour would hinder him from doing that good that he might otherwiſe doe in his calling, and ſo darken Gods graces that are in him, and diminiſh the fruit that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29174:191"/> of them, a man is bound in ſuch caſe to ſtand as earneſtly and as ſtifly for his neighbour, as for himſelfe. Thus we may trie our heart by a ſecond rule, if we can find a tongue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his name againſt backebiters, and doe not for ſlauiſhneſſe or feare or any reſpect ſuffer him to be diſgraced without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſhall eaſily diſcerne what affection we beare to our brothers credit, by our greefe and ſorrow which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue when we heare a true report made of any fault or ſinne that hath indeede blotted him and ruinated his good account. If one be agreeued and ſorrowfull for his neighbours faults, whereby he hath deſerued diſcredit and diminiſhed his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then it is ſure he was well perſwaded of him, ſo farre as was lawfull and had that good deſire that is here commanded. Thus <hi>Ezra</hi> ſhewd how deare the names of Gods people were vnto him, for he hauing heard of that foule and reprochfull ſin that they had taken ſtrange wiues and mingled the holy ſeede with the prophane, he wept and mourned, he hangs downe his head, and confeſſeth that he was aſhamed and could not lift vp his head towards heauen. But what had he done, hee was cleere, one would haue thought he had no cauſe to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he had not offended in this point, a naturall man would rather haue ſaid, you be rude people and baſe, you be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of naughtie perſons what are not you aſhamed to forget God thus? and to goe cleane contrarie to his commandement in this ſort? and ſo falne ſtreight to rating and reuiling them, no he was not of that minde he loued his neighbours name better then ſo, and therefore he pittied them, and was carefull to heale their fault, as he would haue beene dealt with all in the like caſe.</p>
               <p>So that if one haue pittie and compaſſion of his neighbours faults, and pray for him and admoniſh him, and vſe all meanes to bring him to repentance, he loues his neighbours credit, and he that can thus conuert his brother from going aſtray he hath done the part of a good man and louing friende, for hee hath healed the ſoule and cleared the name and couered a multitude
<pb facs="tcp:29174:192"/> of ſinnes. And thus much for this inward dutie, and the three notes and trials of it.</p>
               <p>Now followes the outward duties which are either generall or ſpeciall. And firſt, for the generall. That is to ſpeake the truth from ones heart as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 15. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Not to ſpeake the truth alone but from our heart neither after a flattering &amp; diſſembling manner nor after a rayling and reprochfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not for hope or feare, or that ſo it be wreſted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one by any ſiniſter affection, but heartily to ſpeake iuſt as the cauſe is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeruing ones ſelfe. This is one commendation of Chriſt and a cheefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation that no guile was found in his mouth. But yet theſe two rules muſt be kept in ſpeaking the truth. Firſt, that one ſpeake with a good affection, for if one ſpeake the truth in wrath and paſſion, in a diſtempered minde, the words indeed are not ſinfull, but the manner is wicked, and breakes the commandement. Many will haue a care to ſpeake nothing but that which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtifie &amp; proue to be true, but for their affection it is altogether diſordered, for in a reueng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde, to eaſe themſelues, what euer euill they know by a man, out it ſhall goe without any regard of edifying others, or conuerting the perſons, only in a rage they care not how they diſcredit their neighbour. Now this rude and vngodly ſpeaking of the truth is ſinne againſt our neighbours name, as well as to lye and backebite. So that alwaies truth muſt be bounded with a louing heart with a quiet and well tempered mind, if one ſpeak vnſeaſonably to hurt his neighbour he offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in ſpeaking the truth. So for the end that is the ſecond rule that one muſt looke his ende be good, that one doe ayme at Gods glorie, and the edification of men, for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Colloſſ. 4. What euer you doe let all be done to the glorie of God.</hi> If one be about to ſpeake any thing let him firſt looke what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he may bring to God by ſpeaking it. Secondly, ſee what profit may redowne either to thoſe to whom we ſpeake or to the partie of whom, elſe neuer ſpeake of other mens faults, or of any thing elſe, but when we can ſay this profit will come, either to giue warning to others that they may take
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29174:192"/> heede, or that out ſelues may learne more to hate the ſinne, or that the partie of whome the ſpeach is may be brought to a ſight of his fault, and to amendment. If one cannot ſee ſome good or other that will ariſe by his ſpeach, it is ſure it was ſin and at the leaſt an idle word. So that one muſt ſpeake the truth from his heart with a good affection, and in good diſcretion, ſo that God may haue his due praiſe, and man his due edification. Thus much for the generall dutie. Nowe the ſpeciall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth either others or our ſelues. In ſpeaking of others, theſe rules muſt be obſerued. In prayſing, to ſpeake in ones com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, rather in his abſence becauſe if one be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before ones face, though his commendations be true, yet it ſauours rather of flatterie then liking of the graces &amp; beſides, through our infirmitie it is not without danger of making one proud and conceited. But in ones abſence, ſpeake the truth as much as we can to the praiſe of Gods children, that ſo we may winne more credit to their graces, and they may be able to doe more good with them; and thus as time and place requires, it is dutie to giue due and true commendations to Gods ſeruants. But for reproofe and ſpeaking of others mens faults, doe that alwaies before their faces, the time and ſeaſon of commending is in abſence, but the time and ſeaſon of reprehending is when either the partie alone is preſent, or he is one that is preſent, or at leaſt the thinge may bee brought to him whome it concernes. For ſo the holy Ghoſt commands. Hate not thy neighbour, but tell him plainely of his fault. Till it not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be as plaine and as round with him as one can, ſo that it be in good tearmes and that one know his betters and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. This is contrarie in many that neuer ſpeake ſo much to magnifie ones good parts as when the man himſelfe is within the hearing, and neuer ſo much of ones faults, and frailties as when he is farre enough of, this ſhews that the one comes from a fawning diſpoſition to currie fauour, rather then in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the graces, and the other rather from malice and reuenge, more then from loue and deſite of the parties good. For one ſhould not in modeſtie, make a rehearſall of ones
<pb facs="tcp:29174:193"/> good things before his face, vnleſſe it be when hee is deiected and to much depreſſed to comfort him &amp; to raiſe him vp. And this we muſt obſerue in ſpeaking concerning others. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelues; this muſt be kept, that one ſpeake as ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be either of his infirmities, leaſt it giue a ſuſpicion of pride, or elſe diſgrace himſelfe ſo much that he be made leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe the good he might otherwiſe doe, or elſe of his good thinges, and matters of aduancement, for feare leaſt he ſhould grow at the length to waxe proude and big, in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Now theſe thinges no man in the world is able perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to fullfill, for allmoſt in euerie braunch we are readie to offend continually, but the vſe that wee muſt make is firſt to ſee our wants, then to confeſſe them and acknowledge them in humility before God, and laſtly to pray for aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God, that hath giuen vs an holy heart that we may keepe them and yeeld obedience to them in ſome meaſure of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the firſt fiue commandements, which extende them to all outwarde actions, and all inward thoughts with conſent. Now followeth the tenth &amp; laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="commandment">
               <head>Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe nor his wife nor his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant nor his Oxe nor his Aſſe nor any thing that is his:</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His forbids the leaſt thoughts, and motions of the hart againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour through any conſent or yeelding of the will. And commands ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednes with our owne eſtate as that we neuer haue the ſmalleſt motion te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hurt of our neighbour in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort, yea that we haue ſuch a loue to our neighbour, as we neuer thinke of him or any thinge belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to him, but with deſire of his good euery way, to <hi>couet,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to haue a motion of the heart without conſent of will.</p>
               <p>From this then that God forbids coueting we learne that the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29174:193"/> firſt motion and inclination of the heart to any ſin though a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer yeeld to it, or plot and caſt about how to bring it to paſſe, is a ſin. And the reaſons are plaine; firſt, becauſe God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, as in <hi>Rom 7. Paul</hi> ſaith, he had not known luſt to be a ſin, but that the law ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> He knew, and many heathen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that neuer heard of Gods law, did confeſſe that the inward thoughts, ioyned with conſent and full purpoſe to doe them if occaſion ſerued, were ſins; but for thoſe that did but as it were paſſe through the hart and ſtayd not there, had noe place of abode yeelded to them, but were ſhut out ſo ſoone as they entered, he could neuer be perſwaded that theſe were faults, &amp; prouoked Gods wrath, but that by the law he knew God had ſaid and then he beleeued it. Secondly, if one examine theſe by that generall rule, doe as you would be done by, he ſhall ſee that they agree not with it. For no man would be willing to haue an other man, conceiue the leaſt flying conceit or thought that might hurt him, though he neuer went about to put in practiſe; &amp; therfore alſo muſt be driuen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that it is a ſin in him to haue ſuch thoughts towards an other. 3, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the cauſe it will appeare what they be. They are fruits of originall ſinne and proceede from naturall corruption; now who can drawe a cleane thing out of an vncleane thing, who can pull good fruit out of a bad tree? (being then effects of our naturall pollution that we receiued from <hi>Adam,</hi> for if we had continued in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie we ſhould haue been perfect without any ſuch motion of the inward heart,) they are naught; for what euer coms from ſin is ſin. Laſtly, if the effects be marked they ſhall appeare to be euill. Now Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> 1. 14. ſets downe the effects of theſe euill thoughts &amp; motions, <hi>euery man ſaith he is tempted when he is drawne away by his owne concupiſcence and is inticed.</hi> This Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſhews that let one make as little accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of theſe thoughts as he pleaſe and count them ſmall mattters, yet the worke that they doe is not ſmall; for they draw on a ſide from beholding God, they turne the heart from conſidering God, to marking thoſe things, that he ſhould not, &amp; then when he is puld fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto God, he fals to according and practiſing, and then ſin
<pb facs="tcp:29174:194"/> brings death. So that theſe are like a little ſparke of fire lighting vpon tinder or toe, &amp; ſuch like, that if they be not quickly que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched will grow to a great flame. So the danger is great that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es from euery one of theſe, that we ſo little regard; for there is not the leaſt but it hardens the hart, and withdraws it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and maks it more vnfit to pray or heare, or do any thing that is good, but more eaſily to be drawn to any ſin. And therefore it is not ſlightly to be paſſed ouer. So that becauſe they breake Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, &amp; are againſt the law of charitie and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cauſe, &amp; bring with them ſuch euill effects, therfore the leaſt imagination, ariſing in the heart without any agreeing of the minde to put it in practiſe, is ſin and deſerues death.</p>
               <p>The vſe that we ſhould make of this is for our continuall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, that our nature, &amp; the whole frame of our ſoule &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſuch as no minute almoſt goes ouer our head but ſome ſin, ſome euill and vaine motion or other, goes through our hart &amp; ariſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the puddle of our fleſh; our nature is like ſome great fireband, that if it be neuer ſo little ſtird, ſends forth many ſparkes on euery ſide. Therefore we muſt learne in this regard to deny ourſelues &amp; to fal down before god beſeeching him to heale our nature, &amp; to waſh and clenſe it more &amp; more by his holy ſpirit. Then one hath made one good vſe of the law when he is ſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the ſight of his ſins as that he goes quite out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when the law hath ſo ſtopt his mouth as that he can alledg nothing in himſelfe, wherfore he ſhould not be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned but relies and caſts himſelfe only on the mercies of God in the merits of Chriſt. Againe this teacheth to vſe all good meanes to keepe our heart from theſe ill motions, and hinder this firebrand from ſparking. Firſt, make a cournanant with our eyes to looke vpon nothing, &amp; our eares to heare nothing, and all our ſences to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing into the heart, that may ſtirre vp and prouoke the naughtines of it. Secondly, take downe the fleſh ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faſting and prayer &amp; hearing and ſuch ſpirituall exerciſes, for this is the cauſe why it growes ſo ſtrong becauſe we doe not ſet ourſelues to reſiſt it and fight againſt it. For if we would beſeech God to giue a bleſſing, and vſe all the good means that he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29174:194"/> to kill and crucifie it, it would be a good helpe to vs, and we ſhould preuaile more againſt it. Thirdly, learne to ſet our minde on worke alwaies with ſome good meditation, and holy deſires and thoughts. for mans heart is reſtleſſe, like the watch of a clocke, that while the poyſes hang at it, if it be not ſet right, will goe wrong, ſo while we liue, if we doe not by grace ſet our heart aright towardes God and man, corruption will drawe it wrong. Therefore it is, that many are ſo troubled with ill motions, and continuall boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ill thoughts, becauſe the heart is not buſied and taken vp with ſome good thing, for if grace ceaſe working, corruption wil ſtreight be doing. Thus much for that, that the barethoughts are condemned, if the conſenting be euill, the conceiuing is ſo to, if the proceeding were wicked, the beginning is wicked alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Houſe.</hi>) The houſe is put in the firſt place, not becauſe the houſe is more deere and neere then the wife, but becauſe this iniurie in deſiring the houſe, extendeth it ſelfe to the husband, to the wife, to the children, and ſeruants, yea to the beaſts alſo and cattle, euerie one hath a part in it, it is more generall then the reſt, in hurting, therefore it is placed in the firſt place. In that this breach is ſet in the firſt place that is hurtfull to more, Wee learne that thoſe ſinnes, which are iniurious to more men, are more hurtfull to ones ſelfe, and moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and for this cauſe coueting other mens houſes is ſet in the firſt ranke, and in the chiefe place of it, and moſt abhorde. So in <hi>Eſay,</hi> the Lord pronounceth an eſpeciall woe and curſe againſt thoſe that ioyne houſe to houſe, that they may dwell alone in the land. So in <hi>Iob.</hi> 20. he ſhewes the curſe and vengeance of God that light vpon thoſe which are ſpoylers of houſes. <hi>He puld downe houſes which he built not.</hi> This is the ſinne. It were a foule fault for one to begin well, and end ill, to build houſes for the harbour, and helpe of mankinde, at the firſt, and after to deſtroy and pull downe thoſe which he hath built. But when findes he the world in a good temper, and there was roome enough for his neighbours to dwell by him, before he came, then for him to come and pull downe houſes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people
<pb facs="tcp:29174:195"/> the land, and waſte the countrey, this is a moſt horrible and indigne thing, ſuch as God hath prouided a condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for it. Therefore God will raine vpon his meat, and make him vomit his ſweet morſels, and the arrowes of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſhall pierce through him. <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo ſhews what kind of people they be in the commonwealth, for they are readie to excuſe themſelues, that they meddle with baſe followes, and meane companions, that muſt not be compared with men of ſuch worth as themſelues are, better a thouſand ſuch vermine want ſay they, then a gentleman of place and worſhip be withithout his delights. But they doe not onely meddle with men of the lower ſort, but they giue a ſtroke at the prince, and at the whole land, for <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that the ſtrength of a prince is in the multitude of people, and the brood of mankind; they weaken the ſtate of the prince, and the ſtay of the land, and by conſequence are traytors, &amp; in truth the moſt ſecret vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners of a commonwealth that can be. Theſe are moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, of, that deſolation and deſtruction are in their pathes, and their footſteps, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may tracke them and follow them is waſting, ſpoyling, and pulling downe of houſes.</p>
               <p>This is to proclaime to all the world that one hath no feare of God before his eies. This then to couet another mans houſe is a great fault. Now the meanes whereby we may keepe our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coueting, &amp; much more from taking away his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe, are firſt to conſider, that the houſe he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie is better farre then he deſerues. There is not any that dwels in ſo ſimple a cottage, but he dwels in a better houſe then his merits could purchaſe, yea if he were in a dungeon, for he hath deſerued to be in hell. Then againe it doth not ſeeme good to God, to giue him a better yet, and therefore he ſhould content himſelfe with that, and confeſſe that God is wiſer and knowes what is good for him better then himſelfe. Thirdly, conſider the deceitfulneſſe of our owne hearts. One thinks now that if he had a fairer houſe he ſhould be more at quiet, but may not this be a falſe perſwaſion? may not God croſſe him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29174:195"/> with ſickneſſe and diſeaſes? and then the wals will not comfort him; the roofe and the couering will not bring him any eaſe or helpe, it is not the dwelling that brings quietneſſe, nor the chaunge of the houſe that can ſettle the hart, vnleſſe one change his couetouſneſſe and wickedneſſe, &amp; entertaine contentednes and goodneſſe, he ſhall haue great griefe and vexation in a great deale, but if his heart be good and reformed, he ſhall liue quietly, and die bleſſedly, in what euer houſe or place he dies or liues. <hi>Nor his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is added as the next chiefe thing, and a thing in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof one is next wronged, and indeed eſpecially though the houſe be ſet firſt for the generalneſſe of the hurt. So that hence we may gather that the wife ought to be more deare to one then all his ſubſtance. So <hi>Prouerbs. 19. 9. Houſe and riches are the inheritance of the fathers, but a wife is the gift of God.</hi> Houſe and lands are the gift of God too, but he meaneth a good wife is a more ſpeciall immediate and excellent gift. <hi>And Prouerbs. 31. A vertuous woman is more precious then pearles.</hi> And ſo it is noted that <hi>Adam</hi> was not in his full hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe till God had giuen him <hi>Euah,</hi> ſhe was giuen as the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall outward comfort and vpſhot of the reſt. Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt hence learne to make account of their wifes more then of any earthly thing beſides, for ſhe is fleſh of his fleſh, a part of him, and a member of his bodie which cannot be ſaid of parent or child, or brother, or any kindred. And ſhe may be well valued aboue the pearles. For no Iewels can do that good that a good wife can and doth. For if he haue griefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or buſineſſe and troubles in his outward eſtate, Other things be dumbe, and cannot helpe him, but ſhe can refreſh his ſoule with good counſell, ouerſee his buſineſſe in wiſedome, helpe his bodie againſt incontinencie, and encourage him in his calling, and be a ſtay and ſuccour to him in all things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo thoſe be moſt miſerable and baſe men that ſet their deſire ſo much vpon the outward things of the world, that if their wife and their wealth were laid in the ballance together, they would ſooner part with ten wiues one after another, then
<pb facs="tcp:29174:196"/> looſe any parcell of their commoditie. They would thinke it an iniurie in the wife if ſhe ſhould chuſe rather to haue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band die, then her wealth be taken from her. And why then doe they beare this affection in themſelues? Therefore one muſt pray God to giue him that affection which is due to his wife. For if he loue not at home, he will luſt abroad, and if ſhe haue not her allowance, others ſhal haue more then their allowance. And it confutes thoſe that make it ſo light a thing to wrong an other in his wife the moſt precious thing. Many that woulde count it a baſe thing to ſteale ones horſe, or picke his purſe, yet thinke it no great thing to abuſe the wife, vvhich of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the worſt, all the reſt are to a good husband, but as duſt and chaffe in compariſon. And it would more grieue him, and be a greater indignitie to haue her defiled, then if all the goods were on a light fire before his face. Wiues alſo muſt learne that they carrie themſelues, that they may be worthie this place and account. For howſoeuer her ill dealing muſt not free him from his dutie, yet he ſhall be ſo much the more faultie, and worthie of puniſhent, if being appointed for ſo great an helpe, and to receiue ſo great loue, ſhe be rather a diſcomfort and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, then an helpe and comfort vnto him. Now it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Nor his man ſeruant, nor his maid ſeruant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place God ſets downe the ſeruants before the cattel or the beaſts. Whence we learne that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to make more account of his ſeruants then of any other goods. Becauſe God alwaies makes more account of mankind then any thing elſe, and we muſt eſteeme things according as God values them. Now in the olde law, thoſe that ſhould ſteale any other thing were not to ſuffer death for it, but to reſtore fourefold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, but he that ſhould ſteale a ſeruant, (as then ſome wicked men would, becauſe they ſolde ſeruants in the market as cattle,) he was to die for it. So that we ſee that God preferres a ſeruant before a beaſt, therefore alſo our iudgement and eſtimation ought to be conformable vnto his. So <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith that he would heare his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; giues a reaſon which ſerues for his point to. He that made him in the wombe, did he not make
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29174:196"/> me, ſo that both were made in the wombe, and were equally men, both had one creator, the ſeruant and the maſter equally in reſpect of creation, &amp; then alſo in reſpect of redemption there is no difference bond or free. The ſeruant if he be an elect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, hath as much right in the bloud of Chriſt &amp; ſhall haue as good part of the glorie of Chriſt in heauen as the maſter. And therefore he is farre more excellent, and to be ſet farre aboue all other goods. Likewiſe they are the moſt profitable goods, and in that regard, to be more highly eſteemed of, for if one had neuer ſo many cattle, and no ſeruants to looke to them and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they would yeeld him no commoditie. If one had in his poſſeſſion neuer ſo much land and ground, and had none to manure and husband it orderly, it would bring him no fruit, nor turne to no profit vnto him. Therefore maſters muſt learne to haue a greater care of them, and ſet more by them then by the beaſts, and not be iniurious vnto them though they ſeeme neuer ſo baſe, for the moſt contemptible ſeruant in the world is of more worth in his nature then the moſt excellent bruite beaſt, and the moſt abiect handmaid more excellent in herſelfe, then the moſt precious gold or ſiluer, or ſuch like treaſure. Therefore theſe ſerue to confute the crueltie and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch that doe ſhew more loue and good vſage to the beaſt, then vnto men made after Gods Image committed to their charge. For when their cattle take paines, they prouide, thy ſhall haue their diet ſuitable, and if the cattle be ſicke and diſeaſed, they ſeeke all meanes to haue them cured, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But let their ſeruants labour and trauaile, though they riſe vp hungrie, and goe to bed colde, and haue no due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or looking to, they make no matter of it. And though they be ſicke and weake in their houſe, and lie hard by them, they will not ſo much as go to them with any care or diligence, but rather which is the diuelliſh and cruell greedineſſe, make a pray of them, and rob and ſpoyle them of their wages, if they can make their bargaine ſo. This is a moſt vilde beaſtly ſauage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in truth God paies them for it accordingly, for eyther he lets them haue vnfaithfull ſeruants, or elſe, lets them be in
<pb facs="tcp:29174:197"/> ſuch note, as no ſeruants will abide vvith them, but they haue all the toyle to themſelues, and indeed it is moſt iuſt, that ſith they prize beaſtes aboue men, they and their beaſtes ſhould trie it out together, and ſith they beare a greater affection to their goods then to the image of God and man, their goods ſhould be turned to a burthen and vexation vnto them. Then this ſerues alſo for the inſtruction vnto ſeruants, that ſith God doth preferre them before all other goods, therfore they ſhould ſo behaue themſelues, as they may aunſwere to their place, for there where God giues more vvages he doth require more vvorke, or elſe he vvill lay on more puniſhment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſerues vtterly to condemne ſuch as be idle and vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that if ye looke into them, you can ſee them good for nothing but ſwaggering, ſwilling, and diſguiſing themſelues in their behauiour and apparrell, filthie perſons and vnchaſte, that doe nothing but fill the houſe full of ſinne, and pollute it vvith vnchaſtitie and other like diſorders. Theſe it is iuſt they ſhould be leſſe made of then the beaſts, becauſe they make themſelues worſe then the beaſts, For the oxe and the aſſe or the horſe doe till the ground, and carrie burthens, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſome commoditie to the maſters, but thoſe that will neither doe any good, nor learne any good, but ſet themſelues in their cariage, and croſſe God and his word, and his ſeruants, are more baſe, and more vnprofitable then the earth, and not worthie ſo much honor, vnleſſe they amende, as the oxe or aſſe.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Nor any thing that is his.</head>
                  <p>Seeing he had before touched the matters of greateſt waight in their kinde, and vnder them comprehended the reſt, now hee generally toucheth things of leſſe worth, any thing little or great, worth much or worth little, that is not the queſtion, but if it be thy neighbours, thou ſhalt not haue any motion to hurt thy neighbour in it.</p>
                  <p>So that we muſt obſerue hence, that the leaſt motion after the leaſt thing of our neighbours is ſin; men will (it may be) yeelde that the coueting of a neighbours houſe, wife, ſeruant is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29174:197"/> naught for theſe be matters of ſome wait, but for a little corne, a little graſſe, an apple a point &amp;c. Theſe they ſay be trifles not to be ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nay there is nothing ſo ſmal, but it is ſome thing and being comprehended vnder the word any thing muſt not be coueted. Therefore God to meete with theſe obiectors, as in the fourth commandement, ſo heare hath brauncht out ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulers and at length comprehended all other things not named in a generall terme, that men might haue no ſhift or eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but ſith God forbiddes all coueting in trifles or weightie matters might confeſſe that all is ſinne.</p>
                  <p>This confutes thoſe that for weightie matters, of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will hold their hands at leaſt; but for ſmall things that they thinke a man ſhall not be much the worſe for, they giue libertie not to their hearts only but alſo to their hands, and then they ſay, Oh, this is nothing pray God we may neuer doe worſe indeede it were well that we ſhould neuer doe worſe, but it is not well that one doth ſo ill, for if he doe no worſe but doe this ſtill, this brings him vnder the curſe and will certainly bring him to greater matters; for if a ſparke be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnquencht it will bring a fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, and he that will diſobey God for a little, will diſobey him more for a great deale, and he that makes no bones of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his conſcience for a penny or halfe pennie, he will be more audacious for a pound. And though the matter be ſmall, in which one offends, yet it is not a ſmall matter, nor a little thing to offend againſt God, it is a ſmall thing, but it is ſome thing, and God will not allow it in any thing. He can ſpare it, but god will not ſpare it, ſo that thou ſhouldeſt take it with ſin againſt his law. Therefore the vſe that we muſt make, is to pray God to giue vs ſuch a contented heart, and ſo to like our one eſtate, as that we may couet nothing that belongs not to vs. That we ſhall obtaine if we get a firme and true faith in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencence, and his promiſes. For if one be perſwaded firmely that God hath appointed him this houſe, this wife, this ſeruant, then we ſhall be content, for we muſt needes yeelde that Gods waies be better then ours, that his decree is moſt iuſt in it ſelfe and alſo beſt for vs if we be his. Alſo one muſt haue faith in
<pb facs="tcp:29174:198"/> Gods promiſes, for when one ſees no helpe for him in any but himſelfe, and is not reſolued that God will prouide for him, and ſee that he ſhall lacke nothing then originall ſin will lay about it, and ſeeke to prouide for it ſelfe, and lay about with wiſhng and deſiring Oh, that this, or that, or the other thing, &amp;c. Then I ſhould be well. But if one reſt on Gods promiſes, that hath promiſed he ſhall want no good thing that feares him, and that he will be a ſun and a ſheilde vnto the righteous man; this will breede ſuch contentment, and ſuch reſting on Gods prouiſion as that one ſhall not be troubled, with theſe idle thoughts and wiſhes, for that is none of ours. And thus much for the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue part of this commandement. Now the affirmatiue part is, that we ſhould haue ſuch a charitable affection, to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as that we ſhould neuer haue any motion but to his good in himſelf &amp; euerie thing that belongs to him &amp; euerie thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning him, that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not to his good, is ſin; and thus much for the expoſition of the law. Which muſt ſerue to this end that ſeeing our owne vnrighteouſneſſe and vnſufficiency, we ſhould flie to Chriſt to be our righteouſneſſe and ſufficiency and then to make this the rule of our life, &amp; a lanterne to our feete, that though we cannot attaine to the perfection which the law requires, yet we may haue that vprightneſſe, with which the Goſpell is content:</p>
